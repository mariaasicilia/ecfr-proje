<DIV8 N="§ 1.4" NODE="44:1.0.1.1.2.0.1.4" TYPE="SECTION">

<HEAD>§ 6.86   General exemptions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Whenever the Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency, determines it to be necessary and proper, with respect to any system of records maintained by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to exercise the right to promulgate rules to exempt such systems in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and (k), each specific exemption, including the parts of each system to be exempted, the provisions of the Act from which they are exempted, and the justification for each exemption shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as part of FEMA's Notice of Systems of Records.
</P>
<P>(b) Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) (3) and (4), (d), (e) (1), (2), (3), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), (e) (5) and (8) (f) and (g) of the Privacy Act.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Exempt systems.</I> The following systems of records, which contain information of the type described in 5 U.S.C. 552(j)(2), shall be exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a listed in paragraph (b) of this section.
</P>
<EXTRACT>
<FP-1>General Investigative Files (FEMA/IG-2)—Limited Access</FP-1></EXTRACT>
<P>(2) <I>Reasons for exemptions.</I> (i) 5 U.S.C. 552a (e)(4)(G) and (f)(1) enable individuals to be notified whether a system of records contains records pertaining to them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of these provisions to the above-listed system of records would give individuals an opportunity to learn whether they are of record either as suspects or as subjects of a criminal investigation; this would compromise the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to complete investigations and identify or detect violators of laws administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or other Federal agencies. Individuals would be able (A) to take steps to avoid detection, (B) to inform co-conspirators of the fact that an investigation is being conducted, (C) to learn the nature of the investigation to which they are being subjected, (D) to learn the type of surveillance being utilized, (E) to learn whether they are only suspects or identified law violators, (F) to continue to resume their illegal conduct without fear of detection upon learning that they are not in a particular system of records, and (G) to destroy evidence needed to prove the violation.
</P>
<P>(ii) 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) enable individuals to gain access to records pertaining to them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of these provisions to the above-listed system of records would compromise its ability to complete or continue criminal investigations and to detect or identify violators of laws administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or other Federal agencies. Permitting access to records contained in the above-listed system of records would provide individuals with significant information concerning the nature of the investigation, and this could enable them to avoid detection or apprehension in the following ways:
</P>
<P>(A) By discovering the collection of facts which would form the basis for their arrest, (B) by enabling them to destroy evidence of criminal conduct which would form the basis for their arrest, and (C) by learning that the criminal investigators had reason to believe that a crime was about to be committed, they could delay the commission of the crime or change the scene of the crime to a location which might not be under surveillance. Granting access to ongoing or closed investigative files would also reveal investigative techniques and procedures, the knowledge of which could enable individuals planning criminal activity to structure their future operations in such a way as to avoid detection or apprehension, thereby neutralizing law enforcement officers' established investigative tools and procedures. Further, granting access to investigative files and records could disclose the identity of confidential sources and other informers and the nature of the information which they supplied, thereby endangering the life or physical safety of those sources of information by exposing them to possible reprisals for having provided information relating to the criminal activities of those individuals who are the subjects of the investigative files and records; confidential sources and other informers might refuse to provide criminal investigators with valuable information if they could not be secure in the knowledge that their identities would not be revealed through disclosure of either their names or the nature of the information they supplied, and this would seriously impair the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to carry out its mandate to enforce criminal and related laws. Additionally, providing access to records contained in the above-listed system of records could reveal the identities of undercover law enforcement personnel who compiled information regarding individual's criminal activities, thereby endangering the life or physical safety of those undercover personnel or their families by exposing them to possible reprisals.
</P>
<P>(iii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) (2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(4), which are dependent upon access having been granted to records pursuant to the provisions cited in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, enable individuals to contest (seek amendment to) the content of records contained in a system of records and require an agency to note an amended record and to provide a copy of an individual's statement (of disagreement with the agency's refusal to amend a record) to persons or other agencies to whom the record has been disclosed. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the reasons set forth in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section are equally applicable to this paragraph and, accordingly, those reasons are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
</P>
<P>(iv) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires that an agency make accountings of disclosures of records available to individuals named in the records at their request; such accountings must state the date, nature and purpose of each disclosure of a record and the name and address of the recipient. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would impair the ability of other law enforcement agencies to make effective use of information provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in connection with the investigation, detection and apprehension of violators of the criminal laws enforced by those other law enforcement agencies. Making accountings of disclosure available to violators or possible violators would alert those individuals to the fact that another agency is conducting an investigation into their criminal activities, and this could reveal the geographic location of the other agency's investigation, the nature and purpose of that investigation, and the dates on which that investigation was active. Violators possessing such knowledge would thereby be able to take appropriate measures to avoid detection or apprehension by altering their operations, by transferring their criminal activities to other geographic areas or by destroying or concealing evidence which would form the basis for their arrest. In addition, providing violators with accountings of disclosure would alert those individuals to the fact that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has information regarding their criminal activities and could inform those individuals of the general nature of that information; this, in turn, would afford those individuals a better opportunity to take appropriate steps to avoid detection or apprehension for violations of criminal and related laws.
</P>
<P>(v) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(4) requires that an agency inform any person or other agency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the agency in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) of any record that has been disclosed to the person or agency if an accounting of the disclosure was made. Since this provision is dependent on an individual's having been provided an opportunity to contest (seek amendment to) records pertaining to him/her, and since the above-listed system of records is proposed to be exempt from those provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a relating to amendments of records as indicated in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that this provision should not be applicable to the above system of records.
</P>
<P>(vi) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires that an agency publish a public notice listing the categories of sources for information contained in a system of records. The categories of sources of this system of records have been published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> in broad generic terms in the belief that this is all that subsection (e)(4)(I) of the Act requires. In the event, however, that this subsection should be interpreted to require more detail as to the identity of sources of the records in this system, exemption from this provision is necessary in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and other law enforcement information. Such exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.
</P>
<P>(vii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires that an agency maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or executive order. The term <I>maintain</I> as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3) includes “collect” and “disseminate.” At the time that information is collected by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, there is often insufficient time to determine whether the information is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; in many cases information collected may not be immediately susceptible to a determination of whether the information is relevant and necessary, particularly in the early stages of an investigation, and in many cases, information which initially appears to be irrelevant or unnecessary may, upon further evaluation or upon continuation of the investigation, prove to have particular relevance to an enforcement program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Further, not all violations of law discovered during a criminal investigation fall within the investigative jurisdiction of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; in order to promote effective law enforcement, it often becomes necessary and desirable to disseminate information pertaining to such violations to other law enforcement agencies which have jurisdiction over the offense to which the information relates. The Federal Emergency Management Agency should not be placed in a position of having to ignore information relating to violations of law not within its jurisdiction when that information comes to the attention of the Federal Emergency Management Agency through the conduct of a lawful FEMA investigation. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, therefore, believes that it is appropriate to exempt the above-listed system of records from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1).
</P>
<P>(viii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) requires that an agency collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would impair the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to conduct investigations and to identify or detect violators of criminal or related laws for the following reasons:
</P>
<P>(A) Most information collected about an individual under criminal investigations is obtained from third parties such as witnesses and informers, and it is usually not feasible to rely upon the subject of the investigation as a source for information regarding his/her criminal activities, (B) an attempt to obtain information from the subject of a criminal investigation will often alert that individual to the existence of an investigation, thereby affording the individual an opportunity to attempt to conceal his/her criminal activities so as to avoid apprehension, (C) in certain instances, the subject of a criminal investigation is not required to supply information to criminal investigators as a matter of legal duty, and (D) during criminal investigations it is often a matter of sound investigative procedures to obtain information from a variety of sources in order to verify information already obtained.
</P>
<P>(ix) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requires that an agency inform each individual whom it asks to supply information, either on the form which the agency uses to collect the information or on a separate form which can be retained by the individual, with the following information: The authority which authorizes the solicitation of the information and whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary; the principal purposes for which the information is intended to be used; the routine uses which may be made of the information; and the effects on the individual of not providing all or part of the requested information. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the above-listed system of records should be exempted from this provision in order to avoid adverse effects on its ability to identify or detect violators of criminal or related laws. In many cases, information is obtained by confidential sources, other informers or undercover law enforcement officers under circumstances where it is necessary that the true purpose of their actions be kept secret so as to avoid alerting the subject of the investigation or his/her associates that a criminal investigation is in process. Further, if it became known that the undercover officer was assisting in a criminal investigation, that officer's life or physical safety could be endangered through reprisal, and, under such circumstances it may not be possible to continue to utilize that officer in the investigation. In many cases, individuals, for personal reasons, would feel inhibited in talking to a person representing a criminal law enforcement agency but would be willing to talk to a confidential source or undercover officer who they believe is not involved in law enforcement activities. In addition, providing a source of information with written evidence that he was a source, as required by this provision, could increase the likelihood that the source of information would be the subject of retaliatory action by the subject of the investigation. Further, application of this provision could result in an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the subject of the criminal investigation, particularly where further investigation would result in a finding that the subject was not involved in any criminal activity.
</P>
<P>(x) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) requires that an agency maintain all records used by the agency in making any determination about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination. Since 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3) defines “maintain” to include “collect” and “disseminate,” application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would hinder the initial collection of any information which could not, at the moment of collection, be determined to be accurate, relevant, timely and complete. Similarly, application of this provision would seriously restrict the necessary flow of information from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to other law enforcement agencies when a FEMA investigation revealed information pertaining to a violation of law which was under investigative jurisdiction of another agency. In collecting information during the course of a criminal investigation, it is not possible or feasible to determine accuracy, relevance, timeliness or completeness prior to collection of the information; in disseminating information to other law enforcement agencies it is often not possible to determine accuracy, relevance, timeliness or completeness prior to dissemination because the disseminating agency may not have the expertise with which to make such determinations. Further, information which may initially appear to be inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely or incomplete may, when gathered, grouped, and evaluated with other available information, become more pertinent as an investigation progresses. In addition, application of this provision could seriously impede criminal investigators and intelligence analysts in the exercise of their judgment in reporting on results obtained during criminal investigations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that it is appropriate to exempt the above-listed system of records from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5).
</P>
<P>(xi) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) requires that an agency make reasonable effort to serve notice on an individual when any record on the individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal process when such process becomes a matter of public record. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the above-listed system of records should be exempt from this provision in order to avoid revealing investigative techniques and procedures outlined in those records and in order to prevent revelation of the existence on an on-going investigation where there is a need to keep the existence of the investigation secret.
</P>
<P>(xii) 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) provides civil remedies to an individual for an agency's refusal to amend a record or to make a review of a request for amendment; for an agency's refusal to grant access to a record; for an agency's failure to maintain accurate, relevant, timely and complete records which are used to make a determination which is adverse to the individual; and for an agency's failure to comply with any other provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the above-listed system of records should be exempted from this provision to the extent that the civil remedies provided therein may relate to provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a from which the above-listed system of records is proposed to be exempt. Since the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a enumerated in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (xi) of this section are proposed to be inapplicable to the above-listed systems of records for the reasons stated therein, there should be no corresponding civil remedies for failure to comply with the requirements of those provisions to which the exemption is proposed to apply. Further, the Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed system of records would adversely affect its ability to conduct criminal investigations by exposing to civil court action every stage of the criminal investigative process in which information is compiled or used in order to identify, detect, or otherwise investigate persons suspected or known to be engaged in criminal conduct.
</P>
<P>(xiii) Individuals may not have access to another agency's records, which are contained in files maintained by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, when that other agency's regulations provide that such records are subject to general exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j). If such exempt records are within a request for access, FEMA will advise the individual of their existence and of the name and address of the source agency. For any further information concerning the record and the exemption, the individual must contact that source agency.

<P>(2) <I>Reasons for exemptions.</I> (i) 5 U.S.C. 552a (e)(4)(G) and (f)(1) enable individuals to be notified whether a system of records contains records pertaining to them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of these provisions to the above-listed systems of records would impair the ability of FEMA to successfully complete investigations and inquiries of suspected violators of civil and criminal laws and regulations under its jurisdiction. In many cases investigations and inquiries into violations of civil and criminal laws and regulations involve complex and continuing patterns of behavior. Individuals, if informed, that they have been identified as suspected violators of civil or criminal laws and regulations, would have an opportunity to take measures to prevent detection of illegal action so as to avoid prosecution or the imposition of civil sanctions. They would also be able to learn the nature and location of the investigation or inquiry, the type of surveillance being utilized, and they would be able to transmit this knowledge to co-conspirators. Finally, violators might be given the opportunity to destroy evidence needed to prove the violation under investigation or inquiry.
</P>
<P>(ii) 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) enable individuals to gain access to records pertaining to them. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of these provisions to the above-listed systems of records would impair its ability to complete or continue civil or criminal investigations and inquiries and to detect violators of civil or criminal laws. Permitting access to records contained in the above-listed systems of records would provide violators with significant information concerning the nature of the civil or criminal investigation or inquiry. Knowledge of the facts developed during an investigation or inquiry would enable violators of criminal and civil laws and regulations to learn the extent to which the investigation or inquiry has progressed, and this could provide them with an opportunity to destroy evidence that would form the basis for prosecution or the imposition of civil sanctions. In addition, knowledge gained through access to investigatory material could alert a violator to the need to temporarily postpone commission of the violation or to change the intended point where the violation is to be committed so as to avoid detection or apprehension. Further, access to investigatory material would disclose investigative techniques and procedures which, if known, could enable violators to structure their future operations in such a way as to avoid detection or apprehension, thereby neutralizing investigators' established and effective investigative tools and procedures. In addition, investigatory material may contain the identity of a confidential source of information or other informer who would not want his/her identity to be disclosed for reasons of personal privacy or for fear of reprisal at the hands of the individual about whom he/she supplied information. In some cases mere disclosure of the information provided by an informer would reveal the identity of the informer either through the process of elimination or by virtue of the nature of the information supplied. If informers cannot be assured that their identities (as sources for information) will remain confidential, they would be very reluctant in the future to provide information pertaining to violations of criminal and civil laws and regulations, and this would seriously compromise the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to carry out its mission. Further, application of 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(1), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(2), (3) and (5) to the above-listed systems of records would make available attorney's work product and other documents which contain evaluations, recommendations, and discussions of on-going civil and criminal legal proceedings; the availability of such documents could have a chilling effect on the free flow of information and ideas within the Federal Emergency Management Agency which is vital to the agency's predecisional deliberative process, could seriously prejudice the agency's or the Government's position in a civil or criminal litigation, and could result in the disclosure of investigatory material which should not be disclosed for the reasons stated above. It is the belief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency that, in both civil actions and criminal prosecutions, due process will assure that individuals have a reasonable opportunity to learn of the existence of, and to challenge, investigatory records and related materials which are to be used in legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>(iii) 5 U.S.C. 552a (d)(2), (3) and (4), (e)(4)(H) and (f)(4) which are dependent upon access having been granted to records pursuant to the provisions cited in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, enable individuals to contest (seek amendment to) the content of records contained in a system of records and require an agency to note an amended record and to provide a copy of an individual's statement (of disagreement with the agency's refusal to amend a record) to persons or other agencies to whom the record has been disclosed. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that the reasons set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) of this section are equally applicable to this paragraph, and, accordingly, those reasons are hereby incorporated herein by reference.
</P>
<P>(iv) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires that an agency make accountings of disclosures of records available to individuals named in the records at their request; such accountings must state the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record and the name and address of the recipient. The Federal Emergency Management Agency believes that application of this provision to the above-listed systems of records would impair the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other law enforcement agencies to conduct investigations and inquiries into civil and criminal violations under their respective jurisdictions. Making accountings available to violators would alert those individuals to the fact that the Federal Emergency Management Agency or another law enforcement authority is conducting an investigation or inquiry into their activities, and such accountings could reveal the geographic location of the investigation or inquiry, the nature and purpose of the investigation or inquiry and the nature of the information disclosed, and the date on which that investigation or inquiry was active. Violators possessing such knowledge would thereby be able to take appropriate measures to avoid detection or apprehension by altering their operations, transferring their activities to other locations or destroying or concealing evidence which would form the basis for prosecution or the imposition of civil sanctions.
</P>
<P>(v) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires that an agency maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to be accomplished by statute or executive order. The term <I>maintain</I> as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(3) includes “collect” and “disseminate.” At the time that information is collected by the Federal Emergency Management Agency there is often insufficient time to determine whether the information is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; in many cases information collected may not be immediately susceptible to a determination of whether the information is relevant and necessary, particularly in the early stages of investigation or inquiry, and in many cases information which initially appears to be irrelevant or unnecessary may, upon further evaluation or upon continuation of the investigation or inquiry, prove to have particular relevance to an enforcement program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Further, not all violations of law uncovered during a Federal Emergency Management Agency inquiry fall within the civil or criminal jurisdiction of the Federal Emergency Management Agency; in order to promote effective law enforcement, it often becomes necessary and desirable to disseminate information pertaining to such violations to other law enforcement agencies which have jurisdiction over the offense to which the information relates. The Federal Emergency Management Agency should not be placed in a position of having to ignore information relating to violations of law not within its jurisdiction when that information comes to the attention of the Federal Emergency Management Agency through the conduct of a lawful FEMAs civil or criminal investigation or inquiry. The Federal Emergency Management Agency therefore believes that it is appropriate to exempt the above-listed systems of records from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1).
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).</I> The Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency has determined that certain systems of records are exempt from the requirements of (c)(3) and (d) of 5 U.S.C. 552a.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Exempt systems.</I> The following systems of records, which contain information of the type described in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), shall be exempted from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a listed in paragraph (c) of this section.

<P>(2) <I>Reasons for exemptions.</I> All information about individuals in these records that meet the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3) and (d). These provisions of the Privacy Act relate to making accountings of disclosure available to the subject and access to and amendment of records. These exemptions are claimed because the system of records entitled, FEMA/SEC-1, Security Management Information System, contains investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for access to classified information or classified Federal contracts, but only to the extent that the disclosure would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence. During the litigation process and investigations, it is possible that certain records from the system of records entitled, FEMA/SEC-1, Security Management System may be necessary and relevant to the litigation or investigation and included in these systems of records. To the extent that this occurs, the Administrator, FEMA, has determined that the records would also be exempted from subsections (c)(3) and (d) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) to protect such records. A determination will be made at the time of the request for a record concerning whether specific information would reveal the identity of a source. This exemption is required in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of information compiled for the purpose of determining access to classified information. This confidentiality helps maintain the Government's continued access to information from persons who would otherwise refuse to give it.

<P>(1) The Administrator has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act and this regulation and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.
</P>
<P>(2) Thirty days have elapsed after the Administrator has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. The Administrator will file a report whenever any action is taken under paragraph (a).
</P>
<P>(d) FEMA also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance from FEMA to a recipient when a hearing under § 7.945(a)(1) is initiated.
</P>
<P>(1) New Federal financial assistance from FEMA includes all assistance for which FEMA requires an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities, during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance from FEMA does not include increases in funding as a result of changed computation of formula awards or assistance approved prior to the beginning of a hearing under § 7.945(a)(1).
</P>
<P>(2) FEMA will not begin a deferral until the recipient has received a notice of an opportunity for a hearing under § 7.945(a)(1). FEMA will not continue a deferral for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.
</P>
<P>(3) FEMA will limit any deferral to the particular recipient and particular program or activity or part of such program or activity FEMA finds in violation of this regulation. FEMA will not base any part of a deferral on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not and would not, in connection with new funds, receive Federal financial assistance from FEMA.

</P>
<P><I>Action subject to the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard (FFRMS)</I> means any action where FEMA funds are used for new construction, substantial improvement, or to address substantial damage to a structure or facility.
</P>
<P><I>Actions affecting or affected by floodplains or wetlands</I> means actions which have the potential to result in the long- or short-term impacts associated with:
</P>
<P>(1) The occupancy or modification of floodplains, and the direct or indirect support of floodplain development, or

</P>
<P>(2) Living resource values (providing habitats and enhancing biodiversity for fish, wildlife, and plant resources);
</P>
<P>(3) Cultural resource values (providing open space, natural beauty, recreation, scientific study, historic and archaeological resources, and education; and
</P>
<P>(4) Cultivated resource values (creating rich soils for agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry).
</P>
<P><I>Natural features</I> means characteristics of a particular environment (<I>e.g.,</I> barrier islands, sand dunes, wetlands) that are created by physical, geological, biological, and chemical processes and exist in dynamic equilibrium. Natural features are self-sustaining parts of the landscape that require little or no maintenance to continue providing their ecosystem services (functions).


</P>
<P><I>Nature-based approaches</I> means the features (sometimes referred to as “green infrastructure”) designed to mimic natural processes and provide specific services such as reducing flood risk and/or improving water quality. Nature-based approaches are created by human design (in concert with and to accommodate natural processes) and generally, but not always, must be maintained in order to reliably provide the intended level of service.
</P>
<P><I>New construction</I> means the construction of a new structure or facility or the replacement of a structure or facility which has been totally destroyed. New construction includes permanent installation of temporary housing units. New construction in wetlands includes draining, dredging, channelizing, filling, diking, impounding, and related activities.

</P>
<P><I>Practicable</I> means capable of being done within existing constraints. The test of what is practicable depends on the situation and includes consideration of all pertinent factors, such as natural environment, social concerns, economic aspects, legal constraints, and agency authorities.
</P>
<P><I>Preserve</I> means to prevent alterations to natural conditions and to maintain the values and functions which operate the floodplains or wetlands in their natural states.
</P>
<P><I>Regional Administrator</I> means the Regional Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the Region in which FEMA is acting, or the Disaster Recovery Manager when one is designated.
</P>
<P><I>Regulatory floodway</I> means the area regulated by Federal, State, or local requirements to provide for the discharge of the base flood so the cumulative rise in the water surface is no more than a designated amount above the base flood elevation.
</P>
<P><I>Restore</I> means to reestablish a setting or environment in which the natural functions of the floodplain can operate.
</P>
<P><I>Structure</I> means a walled and roofed building, including a temporary housing unit (manufactured housing) or a gas or liquid storage tank.
</P>
<P><I>Substantial improvement</I> means any repair, reconstruction or other improvement of a structure or facility, which has been damaged in excess of, or the cost of which equals or exceeds, 50 percent of the pre-disaster market value of the structure or replacement cost of the facility (including all “public facilities” as defined in the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988) before the repair or improvement is started, or if the structure or facility has been damaged and is proposed to be restored. Substantial improvement includes work to address substantial damage to a structure or facility. If a facility is an essential link in a larger system, the percentage of damage will be based on the cost of repairing the damaged facility relative to the replacement cost of the portion of the system which is operationally dependent on the facility. The term “substantial improvement” does not include any alteration of a structure or facility listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.


</P>
<P><I>Support of floodplain and wetland development</I> means to, directly or indirectly, encourage, allow, serve, or otherwise facilitate development in floodplains or wetlands. Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to new construction, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials. Direct support results from actions within floodplains or wetlands, and indirect support results from actions outside of floodplains or wetlands.
</P>
<P><I>Wetlands</I> means those areas which are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water with a frequency sufficient to support, or that under normal hydrologic conditions does or would support, a prevalence of vegetation or aquatic life typically adapted for life in saturated or seasonally saturated soil conditions, including wetlands areas separated from their natural supply of water as a result of construction activities such as structural flood protection methods or solid-fill road beds, and activities such as mineral extraction and navigation improvements. Examples of wetlands include, but are not limited to, swamps, fresh and salt water marshes, estuaries, bogs, beaches, wet meadows, sloughs, potholes, mud flats, river overflows, and other similar areas. This definition is intended to be consistent with the definition utilized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

<HEAD>§ 9.5   Scope.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Applicability.</I> (1) These regulations apply to all Agency actions which have the potential to affect floodplains or wetlands or their occupants, or which are subject to potential harm by location in floodplains or wetlands.
</P>
<P>(2) The basic test of the potential of an action to affect floodplains or wetlands is the action's potential (both by itself and when viewed cumulatively with other proposed actions) to result in the long- or short-term adverse impacts associated with:
</P>
<P>(i) The occupancy or modification of floodplains, and the direct and indirect support of floodplain development; or
</P>
<P>(ii) The destruction or modification of wetlands and the direct or indirect support of new construction in wetlands.
</P>
<P>(3) The amendments to this part made on September 9, 2024 apply to new actions for which assistance is made available pursuant to declarations under the Robert T.

</P>
<P>(ii) Projects for which the Agency has proposed a draft of a final environmental impact statement (EIS) which adequately analyzes the action and which was filed before October 1, 1977. Proposed actions that impact wetlands outside of floodplains are not exempt if the EIS:
</P>
<P>(A) Only generally covers the proposed action;
</P>
<P>(B) Is devoted largely to related activities; or
</P>
<P>(C) Treats the project area or program without an adequate and specific analysis of the floodplain and wetland implications of the proposed action.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Decision-making involving certain categories of actions.</I> The provisions set forth in this part are not applicable to the actions enumerated in paragraphs (c)(1) through (10) of this section except that the Regional Administrators shall comply with the spirit of Executive Order 11988, as amended, and Executive Order 11990 to the extent practicable. For any action which is excluded from the actions enumerated below, the full 8-step process applies (see § 9.6) (except as indicated at paragraphs (d), (e), and (g) of this section regarding other categories of partial or total exclusion). The provisions of this part do not apply to the following (all references are to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988, Public Law 93-288, as amended, except as noted):

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988, Public Law 93-288, as amended, between $18,000 and $91,000. Such $18,000 and $91,000 amounts will be adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Department of Labor. For any action which is excepted from the actions listed below (except as otherwise provided in this section regarding other categories of partial or total exclusion), the full 8-step process applies (See § 9.6). The Regional Administrator may also require certain other portions of the decision-making process to be carried out for individual actions as is deemed necessary. Steps 1, 4, 5, and 8 of the decision-making process apply to actions under section 406 of the Stafford Act referenced above except for:
</P>
<P>(1) Actions in a floodway or coastal high hazard area; or
</P>
<P>(2) New construction, substantial improvement, or repairs to address substantial damage of structures or facilities; or
</P>
<P>(3) Facilities or structures which have previously sustained damage from flooding due to a major disaster or emergency or on which a flood insurance claim has been paid; or
</P>
<P>(4) Critical actions.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Abbreviated decision-making process applying steps 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8.</I> The Regional Administrator shall apply steps 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8 of the decision-making process (§§ 9.7, 9.8, 9.10, and 9.11, see § 9.6) to certain actions under Section 406 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act of 1988, Public Law 93-288, as amended, provided in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section. Steps 3 and 6 (§ 9.9) shall be carried out except that alternative sites outside the floodplain or wetland need not be considered. After assessing impacts of the proposed action on the floodplain or wetlands and of the site on the proposed action, alternative actions to the proposed action, if any, and the “no action” alternative shall be considered. The Regional Administrator may also require certain other portions of the decision-making process to be carried out for individual actions as is deemed necessary. For any action which is excluded from the actions listed below (except as otherwise provided in this section regarding other categories of partial or total exclusion), the full 8-step process applies (see § 9.6). The Regional Administrator shall apply steps 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8 of the decision-making process (§§ 9.7, 9.8, 9.10, and 9.11, <I>see</I> § 9.6) to:
</P>
<P>(1) Replacement of building contents, materials, and equipment (section 406).
</P>
<P>(2) Repairs under section 406 to damaged facilities or structures, except any such action for which one or more of the following is applicable:
</P>
<P>(i) FEMA estimated cost of repairs is more than 50 percent of the estimated reconstruction cost of the entire facility or structure or is more than $364,000. Such $364,000 amount will be adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Department of Labor; or
</P>
<P>(ii) The action is located in a floodway or coastal high hazard area; or
</P>
<P>(iii) Facilities or structures which have previously sustained structural damage from flooding due to a major disaster or emergency or on which a flood insurance claim has been paid; or
</P>
<P>(iv) The action is a critical action.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Other categories of actions.</I> Based upon the completion of the 8-step decision-making process (§ 9.6), the Regional Administrator may find that a specific category of actions either offers no potential for carrying out the purposes of the Orders and shall be treated as those actions listed in paragraph (c) of this section, or has no practicable alternative sites and shall be treated as those actions listed in paragraph (e) of this section, or has no practicable alternative actions or sites and shall be treated as those actions listed in paragraph (d) of this section. This finding will be made in consultation with FEMA Resilience and the Council on Environmental Quality as provided in section 2(d) of Executive Order 11988, as amended. Public notice of each of these determinations shall include publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and a 30-day comment period.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).</I> (1) FEMA Resilience shall apply the 8-step decision-making process to program-wide actions under the NFIP, including all regulations, procedures, and other issuances making or amending program policy, and the establishment of programmatic standards or criteria. FEMA Resilience shall not apply the 8-step decision-making process to the application of programmatic standards or criteria to specific situations. Thus, for example, FEMA Resilience would apply the 8-step process to a programmatic determination of categories of structures to be insured, but not to whether to insure each individual structure.
</P>
<P>(2) The provisions set forth in this part are not applicable to the actions enumerated below except that FEMA Resilience shall comply with the spirit of the Orders to the extent practicable:
</P>
<P>(i) The issuance of individual flood insurance policies and policy interpretations;
</P>
<P>(ii) The adjustment of claims made under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy;

<HEAD>§ 9.6   Decision-making process.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Purpose.</I> This section sets out the floodplain management and wetlands protection decision-making process to be followed by the Agency in applying the Orders to its actions. The numbering of Steps 1 through 8 does not require that the steps be followed sequentially. As information is gathered through the decision-making process, and as additional information is needed, reevaluation of lower numbered steps may be necessary.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Decision-making process.</I> Except as otherwise provided in § 9.5 regarding categories of partial or total exclusion when proposing an action, the Agency shall apply the 8-step decision-making process. FEMA shall:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Step 1.</I> Determine whether the proposed action is located in a floodplain and/or a wetland as established by § 9.7; and whether it has the potential to affect or be affected by a floodplain or wetland (see § 9.7);
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Step 2.</I> Notify the public at the earliest possible time of the intent to carry out an action in a floodplain or wetland, and involve the affected and interested public in the decision-making process (see § 9.8);
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Step 3.</I> Identify and evaluate practicable alternatives to locating the proposed action in a floodplain or wetland (including alternative sites, actions, natural features, nature-based approaches, and the “no action” option) (see § 9.9). If a practicable alternative exists outside the floodplain or wetland FEMA must locate the action at the alternative site.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Step 4.</I> Identify the potential direct and indirect impacts associated with the occupancy or modification of floodplains and wetlands and the potential direct and indirect support of floodplain and wetland development that could result from the proposed action (see § 9.10);
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Step 5.</I> Minimize the potential adverse impacts to or within floodplains and wetlands and minimize support of floodplain and wetland development identified under Step 4. Restore and preserve the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains, and preserve and enhance the natural and beneficial values served by wetlands. Integrate nature-based approaches where appropriate (see § 9.11);
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Step 6.</I> Reevaluate the proposed action to determine first, if it is still practicable in light of its exposure to flood hazards, the extent to which it will aggravate hazards to others, and its potential to disrupt floodplain and wetland values; and second, if alternatives preliminarily rejected at Step 3 are practicable in light of the information gained in Steps 4 and 5. FEMA shall not act in a floodplain or wetland unless it is the only practicable location (<I>see</I> § 9.9);
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Step 7.</I> Prepare and provide the public with a finding and public explanation of any final decision that the floodplain or wetland is the only practicable alternative (see § 9.12); and
</P>
<P>(8) <I>Step 8.</I> Review the implementation and post-implementation phases of the proposed action to ensure that the requirements stated in § 9.11 are fully implemented. Oversight responsibility shall be integrated into existing processes.

<HEAD>§ 9.7   Determination of proposed action's location.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Purpose.</I> This section establishes Agency procedures for determining whether any action as proposed is located in or affects a floodplain established in paragraph (c) of this section or a wetland.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Information needed.</I> (1) The Agency shall obtain enough information so that it can fulfill the requirements in this part to:
</P>
<P>(i) Avoid Federal action in floodplain and wetland locations unless they are the only practicable alternatives; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Minimize harm to and within floodplains and wetlands.
</P>
<P>(2) In all cases, FEMA shall determine whether the proposed action is located in a floodplain or wetland. Information about the floodplain as established by paragraph (c) of this section and the location of floodways and coastal high hazard areas may also be needed to comply with this part, especially § 9.11.
</P>
<P>(3) The following additional current and future flooding characteristics may be identified by the Regional Administrator as applicable:
</P>
<P>(i) Velocity of floodwater;
</P>
<P>(ii) Rate of rise of floodwater;

</P>
<P>(vi) Any other applicable flooding characteristics.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Floodplain determination.</I> In the absence of a finding to the contrary, FEMA will determine that a proposed action involving a facility or structure that has been flooded previously is in the floodplain. In determining if a proposed action is in the floodplain:
</P>
<P>(1) FEMA shall determine whether the action is an action subject to the FFRMS as defined in § 9.4.
</P>
<P>(i) If the action is an action subject to the FFRMS, FEMA shall establish the FFRMS floodplain area and associated flood elevation by using the process specified in (c)(3) of this section and one of the following approaches:
</P>
<P>(A) Climate-Informed Science Approach (CISA): Using a climate-informed science approach that uses the best-available, actionable hydrologic and hydraulic data and methods that integrate current and future changes in flooding based on climate science. This approach will also include an emphasis on whether the action is a critical action as one of the factors to be considered when conducting the analysis;
</P>
<P>(B) Freeboard Value Approach (FVA): Using the freeboard value, reached by adding an additional 2 feet to the base flood elevation for non-critical actions and by adding an additional 3 feet to the base flood elevation for critical actions;
</P>
<P>(C) 0.2-Percent-Annual-Chance Flood Approach (0.2PFA): The 0.2 percent annual chance flood; or
</P>
<P>(D) Any other method identified in an update to the FFRMS.
</P>
<P>(ii) FEMA may select among and prioritize the approaches in this paragraph (c)(1) by policy.
</P>
<P>(iii) FEMA may provide an exception to using the FFRMS floodplain and corresponding flood elevation for an action subject to the FFRMS and instead use the 1 percent annual chance (base) floodplain for non-critical actions or the 0.2 percent annual chance floodplain for critical actions where the action is in the interest of national security, where the action is an emergency action, or where the action is a mission-critical requirement related to a national security interest or an emergency action.
</P>
<P>(2) If the action is not an action subject to the FFRMS as defined in § 9.4, FEMA shall use, at a minimum:
</P>
<P>(i) The 1 percent annual chance (base) floodplain and flood elevation for non-critical actions; and
</P>
<P>(ii) The 0.2 percent annual chance floodplain and flood elevation for critical actions.
</P>
<P>(3) FEMA shall establish the floodplain and corresponding elevation using the best available information. The floodplain and corresponding elevation determined using the best available information must be at least as restrictive as FEMA's regulatory determinations under the NFIP where such determinations are available. In obtaining the best available information, FEMA may consider other FEMA information as well as other available information, such as information from:
</P>
<P>(i) Department of Agriculture: Natural Resources Conservation Service, U.S. Forest Service;
</P>
<P>(ii) Department of Defense: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers;
</P>
<P>(iii) Department of Commerce: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;
</P>
<P>(iv) Department of the Interior: Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Geological Survey;
</P>
<P>(v) Tennessee Valley Authority;
</P>
<P>(vi) Department of Transportation;
</P>
<P>(vii) Environmental Protection Agency;
</P>
<P>(viii) General Services Administration;
</P>
<P>(ix) Agencies of State, Regional, and Indian Tribal governments; or
</P>
<P>(x) Local sources such as Floodplain Administrators, Regional Flood Control Districts, or Transportation Departments.
</P>
<P>(4) If the sources listed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section do not have or know of the information necessary to comply with the requirements in this part, the Regional Administrator may seek the services of a professional registered engineer.
</P>
<P>(5) If a decision involves an area or location within extensive Federal or state holdings or a headwater area and FEMA's regulatory determinations under the National Flood Insurance Program are not available, the Regional Administrator shall seek information from the land administering agency before information and/or assistance is sought from the sources listed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Wetland determination.</I> The following sequence shall be followed by the Agency in making the wetland determination.
</P>
<P>(1) The Agency shall consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for information concerning the location, scale and type of wetlands within the area which could be affected by the proposed action.
</P>
<P>(2) If the FWS does not have adequate information upon which to base the determination, the Agency shall consult wetland inventories maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, various states, communities and others.
</P>
<P>(3) If the identified sources do not have adequate information upon which to base the determination, the Agency shall carry out an on-site analysis performed by a representative of the FWS or other qualified individual for wetlands characteristics based on the definition of a wetland in § 9.4.
</P>
<P>(4) If an action constitutes new construction and is in a wetland but not in a floodplain, the provisions of this part shall apply. If the action is not in a wetland, the Regional Administrator shall determine if the action has the potential to result in indirect impacts on wetlands. If so, all potential adverse impacts shall be minimized. For actions which are in a wetland and the floodplain, completion of the decision-making process is required. (<I>See</I> § 9.6). In such a case, the wetland will be considered as one of the natural and beneficial values of the floodplain.

<P>(a) <I>Purpose.</I> This section establishes the initial notice procedures to be followed when the Agency proposes any action in or affecting floodplains or wetlands.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>General.</I> The Agency shall provide adequate information to enable the public to have impact on the decision outcome for all actions having potential to affect, adversely, or be affected by floodplains or wetlands that it proposes. To achieve this objective, the Agency shall:
</P>
<P>(1) Provide the public with adequate information and opportunity for review and comment at the earliest possible time and throughout the decision-making process; and upon completion of this process, provide the public with an accounting of its final decisions (see § 9.12); and
</P>
<P>(2) Rely on its environmental assessment processes, to the extent possible, as vehicles for public notice, involvement and explanation.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Early public notice.</I> The Agency shall provide opportunity for public involvement in the decision-making process through the provision of public notice upon determining that the proposed action can be expected to affect or be affected by floodplains or wetlands. Whenever possible, notice shall precede major project site identification and analysis in order to preclude the foreclosure of options consistent with the Orders.
</P>
<P>(1) For an action for which an environmental impact statement is being prepared, the Notice of Intent to File an EIS constitutes the early public notice if it includes the information required under paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) For each action having national significance for which notice is being provided, the Agency at a minimum shall provide notice by publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and shall provide notice by mail to national organizations reasonably expected to be interested in the action. The additional notices listed in paragraph (c)(4) of this section shall be used in accordance with the determination made under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) The Agency shall determine whether it has provided appropriate notices, adequate comment periods, and whether to issue cumulative notices (paragraphs (c)(4), (6), and (7) of this section) based on factors which include, but are not limited to:
</P>
<P>(i) Scale of the action;

<HEAD>§ 9.9   Analysis and reevaluation of practicable alternatives.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Purpose.</I> (1) This section expands upon the directives set out in § 9.6 of this part in order to clarify and emphasize the requirements to avoid floodplains and wetlands unless there is no practicable alternative.
</P>
<P>(2) Step 3 is a preliminary determination as to whether the floodplain is the only practicable location for the action. It is a preliminary determination because it comes early in the decision-making process when the Agency has a limited amount of information. If it is clear that there is a practicable alternative, or the floodplain or wetland is itself not a practicable location, FEMA shall then act on that basis. Provided that the location outside the floodplain or wetland does not indirectly impact floodplains or wetlands or support development therein (see § 9.10), the remaining analysis set out by this regulation is not required. If such location does indirectly impact floodplains or wetlands or support development therein, the remaining analysis set out by this regulation is required. If the preliminary determination is to act in the floodplain, FEMA shall gather the additional information required under Steps 4 and 5 and then reevaluate all the data to determine if the floodplain or wetland is the only practicable alternative.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Analysis of practicable alternatives.</I> The Agency shall identify and evaluate practicable alternatives to carrying out a proposed action in floodplains or wetlands, including:
</P>
<P>(1) Alternative sites outside the floodplain or wetland;
</P>
<P>(2) Alternative actions which serve essentially the same purpose as the proposed action, but which have less potential to affect or be affected by the floodplain or wetlands. In developing the alternative actions, the Agency shall use, where possible, natural systems, ecosystem processes, and nature-based approaches; and
</P>
<P>(3) <I>No action.</I> The floodplain and wetland site itself must be a practicable location in light of the factors set out in this section.
</P>
<P>(c) The Agency shall analyze the following factors in determining the practicability of the alternatives set out in paragraph (b) of this section:
</P>
<P>(1) Natural environment (including, but not limited to topography, habitat, hazards, when applicable);
</P>
<P>(2) Social concerns (including, but not limited to aesthetics, historical and cultural values, land patterns, when applicable);
</P>
<P>(3) Economic aspects (including, but not limited to costs of space, technology, construction, services, relocation, when applicable);
</P>
<P>(4) Legal constraints (including, but not limited to deeds and leases, when applicable); and
</P>
<P>(5) Agency authorities.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Action following the analysis of practicable alternatives.</I> (1) The Agency shall not locate the proposed action in the floodplain as established by § 9.7(c) or in a wetland if a practicable alternative exists outside the floodplain or wetland.
</P>
<P>(2) If no practicable alternative exists outside the floodplain or wetland, in order to carry out the action the floodplain or wetland must itself be a practicable location in light of the review required in this section.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Reevaluation of alternatives.</I> Upon determination of the impact of the proposed action to or within the floodplain or wetland and of what measures are necessary to comply with the requirement to minimize harm to and within floodplains and wetlands (§ 9.11), FEMA shall:
</P>
<P>(1) Determine whether:
</P>
<P>(i) The action is still practicable at a floodplain or wetland site, considering the flood risk and the ensuing disruption of natural values;
</P>
<P>(ii) The floodplain or wetland site is the only practicable alternative;
</P>
<P>(iii) The scope of the action can be limited to increase the practicability of previously rejected non-floodplain or wetland sites and alternative actions; and
</P>
<P>(iv) Harm to or within the floodplain can be minimized using all practicable means.
</P>
<P>(2) Take no action in a floodplain unless the importance of the floodplain site clearly outweighs the requirements to:
</P>
<P>(i) Avoid direct or indirect support of floodplain development;
</P>
<P>(ii) Reduce the risk of flood loss;
</P>
<P>(iii) Minimize the impact of floods on human safety, health and welfare; and
</P>
<P>(iv) Restore and preserve floodplain values.
</P>
<P>(3) Take no action in a wetland unless the importance of the wetland site clearly outweighs the requirements to:
</P>
<P>(i) Avoid the destruction or modification of the wetlands;
</P>
<P>(ii) Avoid direct or indirect support of new construction in wetlands;
</P>
<P>(iii) Minimize the destruction, loss or degradation of wetlands; and
</P>
<P>(iv) Preserve and enhance the natural and beneficial values of wetlands.
</P>
<P>(4) In carrying out this balancing process, give the factors in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section great weight.
</P>
<P>(5) Choose the “no action” alternative where there are no practicable alternative actions or sites and where the floodplain or wetland is not itself a practicable alternative. In making the assessment of whether a floodplain or wetland location is itself a practicable alternative, the practicability of the floodplain or wetland location shall be balanced against the practicability of not carrying out the action at all. That is, even if there is no practicable alternative outside of the floodplain or wetland, the floodplain or wetland itself must be a practicable location in order for the action to be carried out there. To be a practicable location, the importance of carrying out the action must clearly outweigh the requirements of the Orders listed in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of this section. Unless the importance of carrying out the action clearly outweighs those requirements, the “no action” alternative shall be selected.

<P>(c) This identification shall consider whether the proposed action will result in an increase in the useful life of any structure or facility in question, maintain the investment at risk and exposure of lives to the flood hazard or forego an opportunity to restore the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains or wetlands.
</P>
<P>(d) In the review of a proposed or alternative action, the Regional Administrator shall consider and evaluate: impacts associated with modification of wetlands and floodplains regardless of its location; additional impacts which may occur when certain types of actions may support subsequent action which have additional impacts of their own; adverse impacts of the proposed actions on lives and property and on natural and beneficial floodplain and wetland values; and the three categories of factors listed below:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Flood hazard-related factors.</I> These include, but are not limited to, the factors listed in § 9.7(b)(3);
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Natural values-related factors.</I> These include, but are not limited to: water resource values, as in storing and conveying floodwaters, maintaining water quality, and groundwater recharge; living resource values, as in providing habitats and enhancing biodiversity for fish and wildlife and plant resources; cultural resource values, as in providing open space, natural beauty, recreation, scientific study, historical and archaeological resources, and education; and cultivated resource values, as in creating rich soils for agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Factors relevant to a proposed action's effects on the survival and quality of wetlands.</I> These include, but are not limited to: Public health, safety, and welfare, including water supply, quality, recharge and discharge; pollution; flood and storm hazards; and sediment and erosion; maintenance of natural systems, including conservation and long term productivity of existing flora and fauna, species and habitat diversity and stability, hydrologic utility, fish, wildlife, timber, and food and fiber resources; and other uses of wetlands in the public interest, including recreational, scientific, and cultural uses.

<HEAD>§ 9.11   Mitigation.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Purpose.</I> This section expands upon the directives set out in § 9.6 of this part and sets out the mitigative actions required if the preliminary determination is made to carry out an action that affects or is in a floodplain or wetland.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>General provisions.</I> (1) The Agency shall design or modify its actions so as to minimize harm to or within the floodplain;
</P>
<P>(2) The Agency shall minimize the destruction, loss or degradation of wetlands;
</P>
<P>(3) The Agency shall restore and preserve natural and beneficial floodplain values; and
</P>
<P>(4) The Agency shall preserve and enhance natural and beneficial wetland values.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Minimization provisions.</I> The Agency shall minimize:
</P>
<P>(1) Potential harm to lives and the investment from flooding based on flood elevations as established by § 9.7(c);
</P>
<P>(2) Potential adverse impacts the action may have on others; and
</P>
<P>(3) Potential adverse impact the action may have on floodplain and wetland values.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Minimization Standards.</I> The Agency shall apply, at a minimum, the following standards to its actions to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section (except as provided in § 9.5(c), (d), and (g) regarding categories of partial or total exclusion). Any Agency action to which the following specific requirements do not apply, shall nevertheless be subject to the full 8-step process (§ 9.6) including the general requirement to minimize harm to and within floodplains:
</P>
<P>(1) There shall be no new construction or substantial improvement in a floodway and no new construction in a coastal high hazard area, except for:
</P>
<P>(i) A functionally dependent use; or
</P>
<P>(ii) A structure or facility which facilitates an open space use.
</P>
<P>(2) For a structure which is a functionally dependent use or which facilitates an open space use, the following applies: Any construction of a new or substantially improved structure in a coastal high hazard area must be elevated on adequately anchored pilings or columns, and securely anchored to such piles or columns so that the lowest portion of the structural members of the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above the floodplain as established by § 9.7(c). The structure shall be anchored so as to withstand velocity waters and hurricane wave wash.
</P>
<P>(3) The following applies to elevation of structures:
</P>
<P>(i) There shall be no new construction or substantial improvement of structures unless the lowest floor of the structures (including basement) is at or above the elevation of the floodplain as established by § 9.7(c).
</P>
<P>(ii) If the subject structure is nonresidential, instead of elevating the structure, FEMA may approve the design of the structure and its attendant utility and sanitary facilities so that the structure is watertight below the flood elevation with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
</P>
<P>(iii) The provisions of paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section do not apply to the extent that FEMA Resilience has granted an exception under § 60.6(b) of this chapter, or the community has granted a variance which the Regional Administrator determines is consistent with § 60.6(a) of this chapter. In a community which does not have a FEMA regulatory product in effect, FEMA may approve a variance from the standards of paragraphs (d)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, after compliance with the standards of § 60.6(a).
</P>
<P>(4) There shall be no encroachments, including but not limited to fill, new construction, substantial improvements of structures or facilities, or other development within a designated regulatory floodway that would result in any increase in flood elevation within the community during the occurrence of the 1 percent annual chance (base) flood discharge. Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted within the 1 percent annual chance (base) floodplain unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the 1 percent annual chance (base) flood more than the amount designated by the NFIP or the community, whichever is most restrictive.
</P>
<P>(5) Even if an action is a functionally dependent use or facilitates open space uses (under paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section) and does not increase flood heights (under paragraph (d)(4) of this section), such action may only be taken in a floodway or coastal high hazard area if:
</P>
<P>(i) Such site is the only practicable alternative; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Harm to and within the floodplain is minimized.
</P>
<P>(6) In addition to standards (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section, no action may be taken if it is inconsistent with the criteria of the National Flood Insurance Program (44 CFR part 59 <I>et seq.</I>) or any more restrictive Federal, State or local floodplain management standards.
</P>
<P>(7) New construction and substantial improvement of structures shall be elevated on open works (walls, columns, piers, piles, etc.) rather than on fill, in all cases in coastal high hazard areas and elsewhere, where practicable.
</P>
<P>(8) To minimize the effect of floods on human health, safety and welfare, the Agency shall:
</P>
<P>(i) Where appropriate, integrate all of its proposed actions in floodplains into existing flood warning and preparedness plans and ensure that available flood warning time is reflected;
</P>
<P>(ii) Facilitate adequate access and egress to and from the site of the proposed action; and
</P>
<P>(iii) Give special consideration to the unique hazard potential in flash flood, rapid-rise or tsunami areas.
</P>
<P>(9) In the replacement of building contents, materials and equipment, the Regional Administrator shall require as appropriate, flood proofing and/or elevation of the building and/or elimination of such future losses by relocation of those building contents, materials, and equipment outside or above the floodplain as established by § 9.7(c).
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Restore and preserve.</I> (1) For any action taken by the Agency which affects the floodplain or wetland and which has resulted in, or will result in, harm to the floodplain or wetland, the Agency shall act to restore and preserve the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains and wetlands.
</P>
<P>(2) Where floodplain or wetland values have been degraded by the proposed action, the Agency shall identify, evaluate, and implement measures to restore the values.
</P>
<P>(3) If an action will result in harm to or within the floodplain or wetland, the Agency shall design or modify the action to preserve as much of the natural and beneficial floodplain and wetland values as is possible.

<HEAD>§ 9.13   Particular types of temporary housing.</HEAD>
<P>(a) This section sets forth the procedures whereby the Agency will provide certain specified types of temporary housing at a private, commercial, or group site.
</P>
<P>(b) Prior to providing the temporary housing described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Agency shall comply with the provisions of this section. For temporary housing not enumerated above, the full 8-step process (<I>see</I> § 9.6) applies.
</P>
<P>(c) The actions described in paragraph (a) of this section are subject to the following decision-making process:
</P>
<P>(1) The temporary housing action shall be evaluated in accordance with the provisions of § 9.7 to determine if it is in or affects the 1 percent annual chance (base) floodplain or wetland.
</P>
<P>(2) No temporary housing unit may be placed on a site in a floodway or coastal high hazard area.
</P>
<P>(3) An individual or family shall not be housed in the 1 percent annual chance (base) floodplain or wetland unless the Regional Administrator has complied with the provisions of § 9.9 to determine that such site is the only practicable alternative. The following factors shall be substituted for the factors in § 9.9(c) and (e)(2) through (4):
</P>
<P>(i) Speedy provision of temporary housing;
</P>
<P>(ii) Potential flood risk to the temporary housing occupant;
</P>
<P>(iii) Cost effectiveness;
</P>
<P>(iv) Social and neighborhood patterns;
</P>
<P>(v) Timely availability of other housing resources; and
</P>
<P>(vi) Potential harm to the floodplain or wetland.
</P>
<P>(4) For temporary housing units at group sites, Step 4 of the 8-step process shall be applied in accordance with § 9.10.
</P>
<P>(5) An individual or family shall not be housed in a floodplain or wetland (except in existing resources) unless the Regional Administrator has complied with the provisions of § 9.11 to minimize harm to and within floodplains and wetlands. The following provisions shall be substituted for the provisions of § 9.11(d) for temporary housing units:
</P>
<P>(i) No temporary housing unit may be placed unless it is elevated to the fullest extent practicable up to the base flood elevation and adequately anchored.
</P>
<P>(ii) No temporary housing unit may be placed if such placement is inconsistent with the criteria of the NFIP (44 CFR parts 59 and 60) or any more restrictive Federal, State, or local floodplain management standard. Such standards may require elevation to the base flood elevation in the absence of a variance.
</P>
<P>(iii) Temporary housing units shall be elevated on open works (walls, columns, piers, piles, etc.) rather than on fill where practicable.
</P>
<P>(iv) To minimize the effect of floods on human health, safety and welfare, the Agency shall:
</P>
<P>(A) Where appropriate, integrate all of its proposed actions in placing temporary housing units for temporary housing in floodplains into existing flood warning or preparedness plans and ensure that available flood warning time is reflected;
</P>
<P>(B) Provide adequate access and egress to and from the proposed site of the temporary housing unit; and
</P>
<P>(C) Give special consideration to the unique hazard potential in flash flood and rapid-rise areas.
</P>
<P>(6) FEMA shall comply with Step 2 Early Public Notice (§ 9.8(c)) and Step 7 Final Public Notice (§ 9.12). In providing these notices, the emergency nature of temporary housing shall be taken into account.
</P>
<P>(7) FEMA shall carry out the actions in accordance with Step 8, ensuring the requirements of this section and the decision-making process are fully integrated into the provision of temporary housing.
</P>
<P>(d) The following applies to the permanent installation of a temporary housing unit as part of a sale or disposal of temporary housing:
</P>
<P>(1) FEMA shall not permanently install temporary housing units in floodways or coastal high hazard areas. FEMA shall not permanently install a temporary housing unit in floodplains as established by 9.7(c) or wetlands unless there is full compliance with the 8-step process. Given the vulnerability of temporary housing units to flooding, a rejection of a non-floodplain location alternative and of the no-action alternative shall be based on:
</P>
<P>(i) A compelling need of the family or individual to buy a temporary housing unit for permanent housing; and
</P>
<P>(ii) A compelling requirement to permanently install the unit in a floodplain.
</P>
<P>(2) FEMA shall not permanently install temporary housing units in the floodplain as established by § 9.7(c) unless they are or will be elevated at least to the elevation of the floodplain as established by § 9.7(c).
</P>
<P>(3) The Regional Administrator shall notify FEMA Resilience of each instance where a floodplain location has been found to be the only practicable alternative for permanent installation of a temporary housing unit.

<P>(a) This section sets forth the procedures whereby the Agency shall dispose of property.
</P>
<P>(b) Prior to its disposal by sale, lease or other means of disposal, property proposed to be disposed of by the Agency shall be reviewed according to the decision-making process set out in § 9.6 of this part, as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) The property shall be evaluated in accordance with the provisions of § 9.7 to determine if it affects or is affected by a floodplain or wetland;

<P>(5) Identify the steps necessary to minimize, restore, preserve and enhance in accordance with § 9.11. For disposals, this analysis shall address all four of these components of mitigation where unimproved property is involved, but shall focus on minimization through elevation or floodproofing and restoration of natural values where improved property is involved;
</P>
<P>(6) Reevaluate the proposal to dispose of the property in light of its exposure to the flood hazard and its natural values-related impacts, in accordance with § 9.9. This analysis shall focus on whether it is practicable in light of the findings from §§ 9.10 and 9.11 to dispose of the property, or whether it must be retained. If it is determined that it is practicable to dispose of the property, this analysis shall identify the practicable alternative that best achieves the Agency's mitigation responsibility.
</P>
<P>(7) To the extent that it would decrease the flood hazard to lives and property, the Agency shall, wherever practicable, dispose of the properties according to the following priorities:
</P>
<P>(i) Properties located outside the floodplain;
</P>
<P>(ii) Properties located inside the floodplain but outside of the floodway and the coastal high hazard area; and
</P>
<P>(iii) Properties located in a floodway, regulatory floodway, or coastal high hazard area.
</P>
<P>(8) The Agency shall prepare and provide the public with a finding and public explanation in accordance with § 9.12.
</P>
<P>(9) The Agency shall ensure that the applicable mitigation requirements are fully implemented in accordance with § 9.11(c).

A claim which should have been presented to FEMA, but which was mistakenly addressed to or filed with another Federal agency, is deemed to be presented to FEMA as of the date that the claim is received by FEMA. If a claim is mistakenly addressed to or filed with FEMA, the claim shall forthwith be transferred to the appropriate Federal Agency, if ascertainable, or returned to the claimant.

<HEAD>§ 11.70   Scope and purpose.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3721 to settle and pay (including replacement in kind) claims of officers and employees of FEMA, amounting to not more than $25,000 for damage to or loss of personal property incident to their service. Property may be replaced in-kind at the option of the Government. Claims are payable only for such types, quantities, or amounts of tangible personal property (including money) as the approving authority shall determine to be reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances existing at the time and place of the loss. In determining what is reasonable, useful, or proper, the approving authority will consider the type and quantity of property involved, circumstances attending acquisition and use of the property, and whether possession or use by the claimant at the time of damage or loss was incident to service.
</P>
<P>(b) The Government does not underwrite all personal property losses that a claimant may sustain and it does not underwrite individual tastes. While the Government does not attempt to limit possession of property by an individual, payment for damage or loss is made only to the extent that the possession of the property is determined to be reasonable, useful, or proper. If individuals possess excessive quantities of items, or expensive items, they should have such property privately insured. Failure of the claimant to comply with these procedures may reduce or preclude payment of the claim under this subpart.

<HEAD>§ 11.73   Allowable claims.</HEAD>
<P>(a) A claim may be allowed only if: (1) The damage or loss was not caused wholly or partly by the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant, his/her agent, the members of his/her family, or his/her private employee (the standard to be applied is that of reasonable care under the circumstances); and (2) the possession of the property lost or damaged and the quantity possessed is determined to have been reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances; and (3) the claim is substantiated by proper and convincing evidence.
</P>
<P>(b) Claims which are otherwise allowable under this subpart shall not be disallowed solely because the property was not in the possession of the claimant at the time of the damage or loss, or solely because the claimant was not the legal owner of the property for which the claim is made. For example, borrowed property may be the subject of a claim.
</P>
<P>(c) Subject to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this section, and the other provisions of this subpart, any claim for damage to, or loss of, personal property incident to service with FEMA may be considered and allowed. The following are examples of the principal types of claims which may be allowed, unless excluded by § 11.74.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Property loss or damage in quarters or other authorized places.</I> Claims may be allowed for damage to, or loss of, property arising from fire, flood, hurricane, other natural disaster, theft, or other unusual occurrence, while such property is located at:
</P>
<P>(i) Quarters within the 50 states or the District of Columbia that were assigned to the claimant or otherwise provided in-kind by the United States; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Any warehouse, office, working area, or other place (except quarters) authorized for the reception or storage of property.

<P>(2) <I>Transportation or travel losses.</I> Claims may be allowed for damage to, or loss of, property incident to transportation or storage pursuant to orders, or in connection with travel under orders, including property in the custody of a carrier, an agent or agency of the Government, or the claimant.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Motor vehicles.</I> Claims may be allowed for automobiles and other motor vehicles damaged or lost by overseas shipments provided by the Government. “Shipments provided by the Government” means via Government vessels, charter of commercial vessels, or by Government bills of lading on commercial vessels, and includes storage, unloading, and offloading incident thereto. Other claims for damage to or loss of automobiles and other major vehicles may be allowed when use of the vehicles on a nonreimbursable basis was required by the claimant's supervisor, but these claims shall be limited to a maximum of $1,000.00.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Mobile homes.</I> Claims may be allowed for damage to or loss of mobile homes and their content under the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Claims for structural damage to mobile homes resulting from such structural damage must contain conclusive evidence that the damage was not caused by structural deficiency of the mobile home and that it was not overloaded. Claims for damage to or loss of tires mounted on mobile homes may be allowed only in cases of collision, theft, or vandalism.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Money.</I> Claims for money in an amount that is determined to be reasonable for the claimant to possess at the time of the loss are payable:
</P>
<P>(i) Where personal funds were accepted by responsible Government personnel with apparent authority to receive them for safekeeping, deposit, transmittal, or other authorized disposition, but were neither applied as directed by the owner nor returned;
</P>
<P>(ii) When lost incident to a marine or aircraft disaster;
</P>
<P>(iii) When lost by fire, flood, hurricane, or other natural disaster;
</P>
<P>(iv) When stolen from the quarters of the claimant where it is conclusively shown that the money was in a locked container and that the quarters themselves were locked. Exceptions to the foregoing “double lock” rule are permitted when the adjudicating authority determines that the theft loss was not caused wholly or partly by the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant, their agent, or their employee. The adjudicating authority should use the test of whether the claimant did their best under the circumstances to protect the property; or
</P>
<P>(v) When taken by force from the claimant's person.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Clothing.</I> Claims may be allowed for clothing and accessories customarily worn on the person which are damaged or lost:
</P>
<P>(i) During the performance of official duties in an unusual or extraordinary-risk situation;
</P>
<P>(ii) In cases involving emergency action required by natural disaster such as fire, flood, hurricane, or by enemy or other belligerent action;

</P>
<P>(iv) When using a motor vehicle.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Property used for benefit of the Government.</I> Claims may be allowed for damage to or loss of property (except motor vehicles, see §§ 11.73(c)(3) and 11.74(b)(13)) used for the benefit of the Government at the request of, or with the knowledge and consent of, superior authority or by reason of necessity.
</P>
<P>(8) <I>Enemy action or public service.</I> Claims may be allowed for damage to or loss of property as a direct consequence of:
</P>
<P>(i) Enemy action or threat thereof, or combat, guerrilla, brigandage, or other belligerent activity, or unjust confiscation by a foreign power or its nation:
</P>
<P>(ii) Action by the claimant to quiet a civil disturbance or to alleviate a public disaster; or
</P>
<P>(iii) Efforts by the claimant to save human life or Government property.
</P>
<P>(9) <I>Marine or aircraft disaster.</I> Claims may be allowed for personal property damaged or lost as a result of marine or aircraft disaster or accident.
</P>
<P>(10) <I>Government property.</I> Claims may be allowed for property owned by the United States only when the claimant is financially responsible to an agency of the Government other than FEMA.
</P>
<P>(11) <I>Borrowed property.</I> Claims may be allowed for borrowed property that has been damaged or lost.
</P>
<P>(12)(i) A claim against the Government may be made for not more than $40,000 by an officer or employee of the agency for damage to, or loss of, personal property in a foreign country that was incurred incident to service, and—
</P>
<P>(A) The officer, or employee was evacuated from the country on a recommendation or order of the Secretary of State or other competent authority that was made in responding to an incident of political unrest or hostile act by people in that country; and the damage or loss resulted from the evacuation, incident, or hostile act; or
</P>
<P>(B) The damage or loss resulted from a hostile act directed against the Government or its officers, or employees.
</P>
<P>(ii) On paying the claim under this section, the Government is subrogated for the amount of the payment to a right or claim that the claimant may have against the foreign country for the damage or loss for which the Government made the payment.

<HEAD>§ 11.75   Claims involving carriers and insurers.</HEAD>
<P>In the event the property which is the subject of a claim was lost or damaged while in the possession of a carrier or was insured, the following procedures will apply:
</P>
<P>(a) Whenever property is damaged, lost, or destroyed while being shipped pursuant to authorized travel orders, the owner must file a written claim for reimbursement with the last commercial carrier known or believed to have handled the goods, or the carrier known to be in possession of the property when the damage or loss occurred, according to the terms of its bill of lading or contract, before submitting a claim against the Government under this subpart.
</P>
<P>(1) If more than one bill of lading or contract was issued, a separate demand should be made against the last carrier on each such document.
</P>
<P>(2) The demand should be made within the time limit provided in the policy and prior to the filing of a claim against the Government.
</P>
<P>(3) If it is apparent that the damage or loss is attributable to packing, storage, or unpacking while in the custody of the Government, no demand need be made against the carrier.
</P>
<P>(b) Whenever property which is damaged, lost, or destroyed incident to the claimant's service is insured in whole or in part, the claimant must make demand in writing against the insurer for reimbursement under terms and conditions of the insurance coverage, prior to the filing of the concurrent claim against the Government.
</P>
<P>(c) Failure to make a demand on a carrier or insurer or to make all reasonable efforts to protect and prosecute rights available against a carrier or insurer and to collect the amount recoverable from the carrier or insurer may result in reducing the amount recoverable from the Government by the maximum amount which would have been recoverable from the carrier or insurer, had the claim been timely or diligently prosecuted. However, no deduction will be made where the circumstances of the claimant's service preclude reasonable filing of such a claim or diligent prosecution, or the evidence indicates a demand was impracticable or would have been unavailing.
</P>
<P>(d) Following the submission of the claim against the carrier or insurer, the claimant may immediately submit a claim against the Government in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, without waiting until either final approval or denial of the claim is made by the carrier or insurer.
</P>
<P>(1) Upon submission of a claim to the Government, the claimant must certify in the claim that no recovery (or the amount of recovery) has been gained from a carrier or insurer, and enclose all correspondence pertinent thereto.
</P>
<P>(2) If the carrier or insurer has not taken final action on the claim against them, by the time the claimant submits a claim to the Government, the claimant will immediately notify them to address all correspondence in regard to the claim to him/her, in care of the Chief Counsel of FEMA.
</P>
<P>(3) The claimant shall timely advise the Chief Counsel in writing, of any action which is taken by the carrier or insurer on the claim. On request, the claimant also will furnish such evidence as may be required to enable the United States to enforce the claim.
</P>
<P>(e) When a claim is paid by FEMA, the claimant will assign to the United States, to the extent of any payment on the claim accepted by claimant, all rights, title, and interest in any claim against the carrier, insurer, or other party arising out of the incident on which the claim against the Government is based. After payment of the claim by the Government, the claimant will, upon receipt of any payment from a carrier or insurer, pay the proceeds to the United States to the extent of the payment received by the claimant from the United States.
</P>
<P>(f) When a claimant recovers for the loss from the carrier or insurer before the claim against the Government under this subpart is settled, the amount or recovery shall be applied to the claim as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) When the amount recovered from a carrier, insurer, or other third party is greater than or equal to the claimant's total loss as determined under this subpart, no compensation is allowable under this subpart.
</P>
<P>(2) When the amount recovered is less than such total loss, the allowable amount is determined by deducting the recovery from the amount of such total loss;
</P>
<P>(3) For the purpose of this paragraph (f) the claimant's total loss is to be determined without regard to the $25,000 maximum set forth above. However, if the resulting amount, after making this deduction, exceeds $25,000, the claimant will be allowed only $25,000.

<HEAD>§ 16.150   Program accessibility: Existing facilities.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—
</P>
<P>(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
</P>
<P>(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or
</P>
<P>(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 16.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Methods</I>—(1) <I>General.</I> The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Historic preservation programs.</I> In meeting the requirements of § 16.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 16.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—
</P>
<P>(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;
</P>
<P>(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or
</P>
<P>(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Time period for compliance.</I> The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Transition plan.</I> In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—
</P>
<P>(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;
</P>
<P>(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;
</P>
<P>(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and
</P>
<P>(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.

<HEAD>§ 18.205   Professional and technical services.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 18.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
</P>
<P>(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

<P>(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

<P>(b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.
</P>
<P>(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.
</P>
<P>(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.
</P>
<P>(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.

<HEAD>§ 59.2   Description of program.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 was enacted by title XIII of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Pub. L. 90-448, August 1, 1968) to provide previously unavailable flood insurance protection to property owners in flood-prone areas. Mudslide (as defined in § 59.1) protection was added to the Program by the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-152, December 24, 1969). Flood-related erosion (as defined in § 59.1) protection was added to the Program by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-234, December 31, 1973). The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 requires the purchase of flood insurance on and after March 2, 1974, as a condition of receiving any form of Federal or federally-related financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes with respect to insurable buildings and mobile homes within an identified special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), or flood-related erosion hazard area that is located within any community participating in the Program. The Act also requires that on and after July 1, 1975, or one year after a community has been formally notified by the Federal Insurance Administrator. of its identification as community containing one or more special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), or flood-related erosion hazard areas, no such Federal financial assistance, shall be provided within such an area unless the community in which the area is located is then participating in the Program, subject to certain exceptions. See FIA published Guidelines at § 59.4(c).
</P>
<P>(b) To qualify for the sale of federally-subsidized flood insurance a community must adopt and submit to the Federal Insurance Administrator as part of its application, flood plain management regulations, satisfying at a minimum the criteria set forth at part 60 of this subchapter, designed to reduce or avoid future flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion damages. These regulations must include effective enforcement provisions.
</P>
<P>(c) Minimum requirements for adequate flood plain management regulations are set forth in § 60.3 for flood-prone areas, in § 60.4 for mudslide (i.e., mudflow) areas and in § 60.5 for flood-related erosion areas. Those applicable requirements and standards are based on the amount of technical information available to the community.

<HEAD>§ 59.3   Emergency program.</HEAD>
<P>The 1968 Act required a risk study to be undertaken for each community before it could become eligible for the sale of flood insurance. Since this requirement resulted in a delay in providing insurance, the Congress, in section 408 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-152, December 24, 1969), established an Emergency Flood Insurance Program as a new section 1336 of the National Flood Insurance Act (42 U.S.C. 4056) to permit the early sale of insurance in flood-prone communities. The emergency program does not affect the requirement that a community must adopt adequate flood plain management regulations pursuant to part 60 of this subchapter but permits insurance to be sold before a study is conducted to determine risk premium rates for the community. The program still requires upon the effective date of a FIRM the charging of risk premium rates for all new construction and substantial improvements and for higher limits of coverage for existing structures.

<HEAD>§ 59.24   Suspension of community eligibility.</HEAD>
<P>(a) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance shall be subject to suspension from the Program for failing to submit copies of adequate flood plain management regulations meeting the minimum requirements of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of § 60.3 or paragraph (b) of § 60.4 or § 60.5, within six months from the date the Federal Insurance Administrator provides the data upon which the flood plain regulations for the applicable paragraph shall be based. Where there has not been any submission by the community, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall notify the community that 90 days remain in the six month period in order to submit adequate flood plain management regulations. Where there has been an inadequate submission, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall notify the community of the specific deficiencies in its submitted flood plain management regulations and inform the community of the amount of time remaining within the six month period. If, subsequently, copies of adequate flood plain management regulations are not received by the Administrator, no later than 30 days before the expiration of the original six month period the Federal Insurance Administrator shall provide written notice to the community and to the state and assure publication of the community's loss of eligibility for the sale of flood insurance on the internet or by another comparable method, such suspension to become effective upon the expiration of the six month period. Should the community remedy the defect and the Federal Insurance Administrator receive copies of adequate flood plain management regulations within the notice period, the suspension notice shall be rescinded by the Federal Insurance Administrator. If the Federal Insurance Administrator receives notice from the State that it has enacted adequate flood plain management regulations for the community within the notice period, the suspension notice shall be rescinded by the Federal Insurance Administrator. The community's eligibility shall remain terminated after suspension until copies of adequate flood plain management regulations have been received and approved by the Federal Insurance Administrator.
</P>
<P>(b) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance which fails to adequately enforce flood plain management regulations meeting the minimum requirements set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4 and/or 60.5 shall be subject to probation. Probation shall represent formal notification to the community that the Federal Insurance Administrator regards the community's flood plain management program as not compliant with NFIP criteria. Prior to imposing probation, the Federal Insurance Administrator (1) shall inform the community upon 90 days prior written notice of the impending probation and of the specific program deficiencies and violations relative to the failure to enforce, (2) shall, at least 60 days before probation is to begin, issue a press release to local media explaining the reasons for and the effects of probation, and (3) shall, at least 90 days before probation is to begin, advise all policyholders in the community of the impending probation and the additional premium that will be charged, as provided in this paragraph, on policies sold or renewed during the period of probation. During this 90-day period the community shall have the opportunity to avoid probation by demonstrating compliance with Program requirements, or by correcting Program deficiencies and remedying all violations to the maximum extent possible. If, at the end of the 90-day period, the Federal Insurance Administrator determines that the community has failed to do so, the probation shall go into effect. Probation may be continued for up to one year after the community corrects all Program deficiencies and remedies all violations to the maximum extent possible. Flood insurance may be sold or renewed in the community while it is on probation. Where a policy covers property located in a community placed on probation on or after October 1, 1986, but prior to October 1, 1992, an additional premium of $25.00 shall be charged on each such policy newly issued or renewed during the one-year period beginning on the date the community is placed on probation and during any successive one-year periods that begin prior to October 1, 1992. Where a community's probation begins on or after October 1, 1992, the additional premium described in the preceding sentence shall be $50.00, which shall also be charged during any successive one-year periods during which the community remains on probation for any part thereof. This $50.00 additional premium shall further be charged during any successive one-year periods that begin on or after October 1, 1992, where the preceding one-year probation period began prior to October 1, 1992.

<P>(c) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance which fails to adequately enforce its flood plain management regulations meeting the minimum requirements set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4 and/or 60.5 and does not correct its Program deficiencies and remedy all violations to the maximum extent possible in accordance with compliance deadlines established during a period of probation shall be subject to suspension of its Program eligibility. Under such circumstances, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall grant the community 30 days in which to show cause why it should not be suspended. The Federal Insurance Administrator may conduct a hearing, written or oral, before commencing suspensive action. If a community is to be suspended, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall inform it upon 30 days prior written notice and upon publication of its loss of eligibility for the sale of flood insurance on the internet or by another comparable method. In the event of impending suspension, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall issue a press release to the local media explaining the reasons and effects of the suspension. The community's eligibility shall only be reinstated by the Federal Insurance Administrator upon his receipt of a local legislative or executive measure reaffirming the community's formal intent to adequately enforce the flood plain management requirements of this subpart, together with evidence of action taken by the community to correct Program deficiencies and remedy to the maximum extent possible those violations which caused the suspension. In certain cases, the Federal Insurance Administrator, in order to evaluate the community's performance under the terms of its submission, may withhold reinstatement for a period not to exceed one year from the date of his receipt of the satisfactory submission or place the community on probation as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section.
</P>
<P>(d) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance which repeals its flood plain management regulations, allows its regulations to lapse, or amends its regulations so that they no longer meet the minimum requirements set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4 and/or 60.5 shall be suspended from the Program. If a community is to be suspended, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall inform it upon 30 days prior written notice and upon publication of its loss of eligibly for the sale of flood insurance on the internet or by another comparable method. The community eligibility shall remain terminated after suspension until copies of adequate flood plain management regulations have been received and approved by the Federal Insurance Administrator.
</P>
<P>(e) A community eligible for the sale of flood insurance may withdraw from the Program by submitting to the Federal Insurance Administrator a copy of a legislative action that explicitly states its desire to withdraw from the National Flood Insurance Program. Upon receipt of a certified copy of a final legislative action, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall withdraw the community from the Program and publish its loss of eligibility for the sale of flood insurance on the internet or by another comparable method. A community that has withdrawn from the Program may be reinstated if its submits the application materials specified in § 59.22(a).
</P>
<P>(f) If during a period of ineligibility under paragraphs (a), (d), or (e) of this section, a community has permitted actions to take place that have aggravated existing flood plain, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and/or flood related erosion hazards, the Federal Insurance Administrator may withhold reinstatement until the community submits evidence that it has taken action to remedy to the maximum extent possible the increased hazards. The Federal Insurance Administrator may also place the reinstated community on probation as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section.
</P>
<P>(g) The Federal Insurance Administrator shall promptly notify the servicing company and any insurers issuing flood insurance pursuant to an arrangement with the Federal Insurance Administrator of those communities whose eligibility has been suspended or which have withdrawn from the program. Flood insurance shall not be sold or renewed in those communities. Policies sold or renewed within a community during a period of ineligibility are deemed to be voidable by the Federal Insurance Administrator whether or not the parties to sale or renewal had actual notice of the ineligibility.

<HEAD>§ 60.1   Purpose of subpart.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Act provides that flood insurance shall not be sold or renewed under the program within a community, unless the community has adopted adequate flood plain management regulations consistent with Federal criteria. Responsibility for establishing such criteria is delegated to the Federal Insurance Administrator.
</P>
<P>(b) This subpart sets forth the criteria developed in accordance with the Act by which the Federal Insurance Administrator will determine the adequacy of a community's flood plain management regulations. These regulations must be legally-enforceable, applied uniformly throughout the community to all privately and publicly owned land within flood-prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas, and the community must provide that the regulations take precedence over any less restrictive conflicting local laws, ordinances or codes. Except as otherwise provided in § 60.6, the adequacy of such regulations shall be determined on the basis of the standards set forth in § 60.3 for flood-prone areas, § 60.4 for mudslide areas and § 60.5 for flood-related erosion areas.
</P>
<P>(c) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed as modifying or replacing the general requirement that all eligible communities must take into account flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and flood-related erosion hazards, to the extent that they are known, in all official actions relating to land management and use.
</P>
<P>(d) The criteria set forth in this subpart are minimum standards for the adoption of flood plain management regulations by flood-prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone and flood-related erosion-prone communities. Any community may exceed the minimum criteria under this part by adopting more comprehensive flood plain management regulations utilizing the standards such as contained in subpart C of this part. In some instances, community officials may have access to information or knowledge of conditions that require, particularly for human safety, higher standards than the minimum criteria set forth in subpart A of this part. Therefore, any flood plain management regulations adopted by a State or a community which are more restrictive than the criteria set forth in this part are encouraged and shall take precedence.

<HEAD>§ 60.3   Flood plain management criteria for flood-prone areas.</HEAD>
<P>The Federal Insurance Administrator will provide the data upon which flood plain management regulations shall be based. If the Federal Insurance Administrator has not provided sufficient data to furnish a basis for these regulations in a particular community, the community shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize data available from other Federal, State or other sources pending receipt of data from the Federal Insurance Administrator. However, when special flood hazard area designations and water surface elevations have been furnished by the Federal Insurance Administrator, they shall apply. The symbols defining such special flood hazard designations are set forth in § 64.3 of this subchapter. In all cases the minimum requirements governing the adequacy of the flood plain management regulations for flood-prone areas adopted by a particular community depend on the amount of technical data formally provided to the community by the Federal Insurance Administrator. Minimum standards for communities are as follows:
</P>
<P>(a) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has not defined the special flood hazard areas within a community, has not provided water surface elevation data, and has not provided sufficient data to identify the floodway or coastal high hazard area, but the community has indicated the presence of such hazards by submitting an application to participate in the Program, the community shall:
</P>
<P>(1) Require permits for all proposed construction or other development in the community, including the placement of manufactured homes, so that it may determine whether such construction or other development is proposed within flood-prone areas;
</P>
<P>(2) Review proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by Federal or State law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334;
</P>
<P>(3) Review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a flood-prone area, all new construction and substantial improvements shall (i) be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, (ii) be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage, (iii) be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages, and (iv) be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
</P>
<P>(4) Review subdivision proposals and other proposed new development, including manufactured home parks or subdivisions, to determine whether such proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision proposal or other proposed new development is in a flood-prone area, any such proposals shall be reviewed to assure that (i) all such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage within the flood-prone area, (ii) all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and (iii) adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards;
</P>
<P>(5) Require within flood-prone areas new and replacement water supply systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and
</P>
<P>(6) Require within flood-prone areas (i) new and replacement sanitary sewage systems to be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters and (ii) onsite waste disposal systems to be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
</P>
<P>(b) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has designated areas of special flood hazards (A zones) by the publication of a community's FHBM or FIRM, but has neither produced water surface elevation data nor identified a floodway or coastal high hazard area, the community shall:
</P>
<P>(1) Require permits for all proposed construction and other developments including the placement of manufactured homes, within Zone A on the community's FHBM or FIRM;
</P>
<P>(2) Require the application of the standards in paragraphs (a) (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this section to development within Zone A on the community's FHBM or FIRM;
</P>
<P>(3) Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation data;

</FP>
<P>(d) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has provided a notice of final base flood elevations within Zones A1-30 and/or AE on the community's FIRM and, if appropriate, has designated AO zones, AH zones, A99 zones, and A zones on the community's FIRM, and has provided data from which the community shall designate its regulatory floodway, the community shall:
</P>
<P>(1) Meet the requirements of paragraphs (c) (1) through (14) of this section;
</P>
<P>(2) Select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point;
</P>
<P>(3) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge;
</P>
<P>(4) Notwithstanding any other provisions of § 60.3, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of § 65.12, and receives the approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator.
</P>
<P>(e) When the Federal Insurance Administrator has provided a notice of final base flood elevations within Zones A1-30 and/or AE on the community's FIRM and, if appropriate, has designated AH zones, AO zones, A99 zones, and A zones on the community's FIRM, and has identified on the community's FIRM coastal high hazard areas by designating Zones V1-30, VE, and/or V, the community shall:

<HEAD>§ 60.5   Flood plain management criteria for flood-related erosion-prone areas.</HEAD>
<P>The Federal Insurance Administrator will provide the data upon which flood plain management regulations for flood-related erosion-prone areas shall be based. If the Federal Insurance Administrator has not provided sufficient data to furnish a basis for these regulations in a particular community, the community shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize data available from other Federal, State or other sources, pending receipt of data from the Federal Insurance Administrator.

<HEAD>§ 60.6   Variances and exceptions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Federal Insurance Administrator does not set forth absolute criteria for granting variances from the criteria set forth in §§ 60.3, 60.4, and 60.5. The issuance of a variance is for flood plain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. The community, after examining the applicant's hardships, shall approve or disapprove a request. While the granting of variances generally is limited to a lot size less than one-half acre (as set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section), deviations from that limitation may occur. However, as the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing a variance increases. The Federal Insurance Administrator may review a community's findings justifying the granting of variances, and if that review indicates a pattern inconsistent with the objectives of sound flood plain management, the Federal Insurance Administrator may take appropriate action under § 59.24(b) of this subchapter. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. Procedures for the granting of variances by a community are as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) Variances shall not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result;
</P>
<P>(2) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, in conformance with the procedures of paragraphs (a) (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this section;
</P>
<P>(3) Variances shall only be issued by a community upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;
</P>
<P>(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief;
</P>
<P>(5) A community shall notify the applicant in writing over the signature of a community official that (i) the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and (ii) such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions as required in paragraph (a)(6) of this section; and
</P>
<P>(6) A community shall (i) maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and (ii) report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administrator.
</P>
<P>(7) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that (i) the criteria of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section are met, and (ii) the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
</P>
<P>(b)(1) The requirement that each flood-prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone, and flood-related erosion prone community must adopt and submit adequate flood plain management regulations as a condition of initial and continued flood insurance eligibility is statutory and cannot be waived, and such regulations shall be adopted by a community within the time periods specified in § 60.3, § 60.4 or § 60.5. However, certain exceptions from the standards contained in this subpart may be permitted where the Federal Insurance Administrator recognizes that, because of extraordinary circumstances, local conditions may render the application of certain standards the cause for severe hardship and gross inequity for a particular community. Consequently, a community proposing the adoption of flood plain management regulations which vary from the standards set forth in § 60.3, § 60.4, or § 60.5, shall explain in writing to the Federal Insurance Administrator the nature and extent of and the reasons for the exception request and shall include sufficient supporting economic, environmental, topographic, hydrologic, and other scientific and technical data, and data with respect to the impact on public safety and the environment.
</P>
<P>(2) The Federal Insurance Administrator shall prepare a Special Environmental Clearance to determine whether the proposal for an exception under paragraph (b)(1) of this section will have significant impact on the human environment. The decision whether an Environmental Impact Statement or other environmental document will be prepared, will be made in accordance with applicable environmental and historic preservation laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and agency policy. Ninety or more days may be required for an environmental quality clearance if the proposed exception will have significant impact on the human environment thereby requiring an EIS.
</P>
<P>(c) A community may propose flood plain management measures which adopt standards for floodproofed residential basements below the base flood level in zones A1-30, AH, AO, and AE which are not subject to tidal flooding. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section the Federal Insurance Administrator may approve the proposal provided that:
</P>
<P>(1) The community has demonstrated that areas of special flood hazard in which basements will be permitted are subject to shallow and low velocity flooding and that there is adequate flood warning time to ensure that all residents are notified of impending floods. For the purposes of this paragraph flood characteristics must include:
</P>

<HEAD>§ 61.7   Risk premium rate determinations.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Pursuant to section 1307 of the Act, the Federal Insurance Administrator is authorized to undertake studies and investigations to enable him/her to estimate the risk premium rates necessary to provide flood insurance in accordance with accepted actuarial principles, including applicable operating costs and allowances. Such rates are also referred to in this subchapter as “actuarial rates.”
</P>
<P>(b) The Federal Insurance Administrator is also authorized to prescribe by regulation the rates which can reasonably be charged to insureds in order to encourage them to purchase the flood insurance made available under the Program. Such rates are referred to in this subchapter as “chargeable rates.” For areas having special flood, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), and flood-related erosion hazards, chargeable rates are usually lower than actuarial rates.

<P>(a) During the 13-month period beginning on the effective date of a revised Flood Hazard Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map for a community, the effective date and time of any initial flood insurance coverage shall be 12:01 a.m. (local time) on the first calendar day after the application date and the presentment of payment of premium; for example, a flood insurance policy applied for with the payment of the premium on May 1 will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on May 2.
</P>
<P>(b) Where the initial purchase of flood insurance is in connection with the making, increasing, extension, or renewal of a loan, the coverage with respect to the property which is the subject of the loan shall be effective as of the time of the loan closing, provided the written request for the coverage is received by the NFIP and the flood insurance policy is applied for and the presentment of payment of premium is made at or prior to the loan closing.
</P>
<P>(c) Where the following conditions are met, the effective date and time of any initial purchase of flood insurance coverage for any privately-owned property will be 12:01 a.m. (local time) on the first calendar day after the application date and the presentment of payment of premium:
</P>
<P>(1) The Administrator has determined that the property is affected by flooding on Federal land that is a result of, or is exacerbated by, post-wildfire conditions, after consultation with an authorized employee of the Federal agency that has jurisdiction of the land on which the wildfire that caused the post-wildfire conditions occurred; and
</P>
<P>(2) The flood insurance coverage was purchased not later than 60 calendar days after the fire containment date, as determined by the appropriate Federal employee, relating to the wildfire that caused the post-wildfire conditions described in clause (1).
</P>
<P>(d) Except as provided by paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, the effective date and time of any new policy, added coverage, or increase in the amount of coverage will be 12:01 a.m. (local time) on the 30th calendar day after the application date and the presentment of payment of premium; for example, a flood insurance policy applied for with the payment of the premium on May 1 will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on May 31.
</P>
<P>(e) Adding new coverage or increasing the amount of coverage in force is permitted during the term of any policy, subject to any applicable waiting periods. The additional premium for any new coverage or increase in the amount of coverage will be calculated pro rata in accordance with the rates currently in force.
</P>
<P>(f) With respect to any submission of an application in connection with new business, the payment by an insured to an agent or the issuance of premium payment by the agent does not constitute payment to the NFIP. Therefore, it is important that an application for flood insurance, as well as the full amount due, be mailed to the NFIP promptly in order to have the effective date of the coverage based on the application date plus the waiting period. If the application and the full amount due are received at the office of the NFIP within ten (10) calendar days from the date of application, the waiting period will be calculated from the date of application. Also, as an alternative, in those cases where the application and premium payment are mailed by certified mail within four (4) calendar days from the date of application, the waiting period will be calculated from the date of application even though the application and full amount due are received at the office of the NFIP after ten (10) calendar days following the date of application. Thus, if the application and premium payment are received after ten (10) calendar days from the date of the application or are not mailed by certified mail within four (4) calendar days from the date of application, the waiting period will be calculated from the date of receipt at the office of the NFIP. To determine the effective date of any coverage added by endorsement to a flood insurance policy already in effect, substitute the term <I>endorsement</I> for the term <I>application</I> in this paragraph (f).
</P>
<P>(g) The rules set forth in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section apply to Write Your Own (WYO) companies, except that agents must mail the premium payments and accompanying applications and endorsements to the WYO company and the WYO company must receive the applications and endorsements, rather than the NFIP.

<P>(a) Where the Federal Insurance Administrator determines that a community has made adequate progress on the construction of a flood protection system involving Federal funds which will significantly limit the area of special flood hazards, the applicable risk premium rates for any property, located within a special flood hazard area intended to be protected directly by such system will be those risk premium rates which would be applicable when the system is complete.
</P>
<P>(b) Adequate progress in paragraph (a) of this section means that the community has provided information to the Federal Insurance Administrator sufficient to determine that substantial completion of the flood protection system has been effected because:
</P>
<P>(1) 100 percent of the total financial project cost of the completed flood protection system has been authorized;
</P>
<P>(2) At least 60 percent of the total financial project cost of the completed flood protection system has been appropriated;

Such facts shall include information sufficient to identify all persons affected by such flood protection system or by such request: A full and precise statement of intended purposes of the flood protection system; and a carefully detailed description of such project, including construction completion target dates. In addition, true copies of all contracts, agreements, leases, instruments, and other documents involved must be submitted with the request. Relevant facts reflected in documents, however, must be included in the statement and not merely incorporated by reference, and must be accompanied by an analysis of their bearing on the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, specifying the pertinent provisions. The request must contain a statement whether, to the best of the knowledge of the person responsible for preparing the application for the community, the flood protection system is currently the subject matter of litigation before any Federal, State or local court or administrative agency, and the purpose of that litigation. The request must also contain a statement as to whether the community has previously requested a determination with respect to the same subject matter from the Federal Insurance Administrator, detailing the disposition of such previous request. As documents become part of the file and cannot be returned, the original documents should not be submitted.

<P>(e) A responsible official of a community which received a determination that adequate progress has been made towards completion of a flood protection system shall certify to the Federal Insurance Administrator annually on the anniversary date of receipt of such determination that no present delay in completion of the system is attributable to local sponsors of the system, and that a good faith effort is being made to complete the project.

<P>(a) A Group Flood Insurance Policy (GFIP) is a policy covering all individuals named by a State as recipients under section 408 of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5174) of an Individuals and Households Program (IHP) award for flood damage as a result of major disaster declaration by the President. 
</P>
<P>(b) The premium for the GFIP is a flat fee of $600 per insured. We may adjust the premium to reflect NFIP loss experience and any adjustment of benefits under the IHP program. 
</P>
<P>(c) The amount of coverage is equivalent to the maximum grant amount established under section 408 of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5174). 
</P>
<P>(d) The term of the GFIP is for 36 months and begins 60 days after the date of the disaster declaration. 
</P>
<P>(e) Coverage for individual grantees begins on the thirtieth day after the NFIP receives the required data for individual grantees and their premium payments. 
</P>
<P>(f) We will send a Certificate of Flood Insurance to each individual insured under the GFIP. 
</P>
<P>(g) The GFIP is the Standard Flood Insurance Policy Dwelling Form (a copy of which is included in appendix A(1) of this part), except that:
</P>
<P>(1) VI. DEDUCTIBLES does not apply to the GFIP. A special deductible of $200 (applicable separately to any building loss and any contents loss) applies to insured flood-damage losses sustained by the insured property in the course of any subsequent flooding event during the term of the GFIP. The deductible does not apply to: 
</P>
<P>(i) III.C.2. Loss Avoidance Measures; or 
</P>
<P>(ii) III. C.3. Condominium Loss Assessments coverage. 
</P>
<P>(2) VIII. POLICY NULLIFICATION, CANCELLATION, AND NON-RENEWAL, C. Cancellation of the Policy by You, does not apply to the GFIP.

</P>
<P>(h) We will send a notice to the GFIP certificate holders approximately 60 days before the end of the thirty-six month term of the GFIP. The notice will encourage them to contact a local insurance agent or producer or a private insurance company selling NFIP policies under the Write Your Own program of the NFIP Standard Flood Insurance Policy, and advise them as to the amount of coverage they must maintain in order not to jeopardize their eligibility for future disaster assistance. The IHP program will provide the NFIP the amount of flood insurance coverage to be maintained by certificate holders.

<P>Please read the policy carefully. The flood insurance provided is subject to limitations, restrictions, and exclusions.
</P>
<HD1>I. Agreement
</HD1>
<P>A. This policy insures the following types of property only:
</P>
<P>1. A one to four family residential building, not under a condominium form of ownership;
</P>
<P>2. A single-family dwelling unit in a condominium building; and
</P>
<P>3. Personal property in a building.
</P>
<P>B. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides flood insurance under the terms of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and its amendments, and Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
</P>
<P>C. We will pay you for direct physical loss by or from flood to your insured property if you:
</P>
<P>1. Have paid the full amount due (including applicable premiums, surcharges, and fees);
</P>
<P>2. Comply with all terms and conditions of this policy; and
</P>
<P>3. Have furnished accurate information and statements.
</P>
<P>D. We have the right to review the information you give us at any time and revise your policy based on our review.
</P>
<P>E. This policy insures only one building. If you own more than one building, coverage will apply to the single building specifically described in the Flood Insurance Application.
</P>
<P>F. Subject to the exception in I.G below, multiple policies with building coverage cannot be issued to insure a single building to one insured or to different insureds, even if separate policies were issued through different NFIP insurers. Payment for damages may only be made under a single policy for building damages under Coverage A—Building Property.
</P>
<P>G. A Dwelling Form policy with building coverage may be issued to a unit owner in a condominium building that is also insured under a Residential Condominium Building Association Policy (RCBAP). However, no more than $250,000 may be paid in combined benefits for a single unit under the Dwelling Form policy and the RCBAP. We will only pay for damage once. Items of damage paid for under an RCBAP cannot also be claimed under the Dwelling Form policy.

The policy will also cover improvements made or acquired solely at your expense in the dwelling or apartment in which you reside, but for not more than 10 percent of the limit of liability shown for personal property on the Declarations Page. Use of this insurance is at your option but reduces the personal property limit of liability.

</P>
<P>b. If you or a member of your household perform the removal work, the value of your work will be based on the Federal minimum wage.
</P>
<P>c. This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.
</P>
<HD3>2. Loss Avoidance Measures
</HD3>
<HD3>a. Sandbags, Supplies, and Labor

</P>
<P>(b) A legally authorized official must issue an evacuation order or other civil order for the community in which the building is located calling for measures to preserve life and property from the peril of flood.
</P>
<P>This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.
</P>
<HD3>b. Property Removed to Safety
</HD3>
<P>(1) We will pay up to $1,000 for the reasonable expenses you incur to move insured property to a place other than the described location that contains the property in order to protect it from flood or the imminent danger of flood. Reasonable expenses include the value of work, at the Federal minimum wage, you or a member of your household perform.
</P>
<P>(2) If you move insured property to a location other than the described location that contains the property in order to protect it from flood or the imminent danger of flood, we will cover such property while at that location for a period of 45 consecutive days from the date you begin to move it there. The personal property that is moved must be placed in a fully enclosed building or otherwise reasonably protected from the elements.
</P>
<P>(3) Any property removed, including a moveable home described in II.6.b and c, must be placed above ground level or outside of the special flood hazard area.
</P>
<P>(4) This coverage does not increase the Coverage A or Coverage B limit of liability.
</P>
<HD3>3. Condominium Loss Assessments
</HD3>
<P>a. Subject to III.C.3.b below, if this policy insures a condominium unit, we will pay, up to the Coverage A limit of liability, your share of loss assessments charged against you by the condominium association in accordance with the condominium association's articles of association, declarations and your deed. The assessment must be made because of direct physical loss by or from flood during the policy term, to the unit or to the common elements of the NFIP insured condominium building in which this unit is located.
</P>
<P>b. We will not pay any loss assessment:
</P>
<P>(1) Charged against you and the condominium association by any governmental body;
</P>
<P>(2) That results from a deductible under the insurance purchased by the condominium association insuring common elements;
</P>
<P>(3) That results from a loss to personal property, including contents of a condominium building;
</P>
<P>(4) In which the total payment combined under all policies exceeds the maximum amount of coverage available under the Act for a single unit in a condominium building where the unit is insured under both a Dwelling Policy and a RCBAP; or
</P>
<P>(5) On any item of damage that has already been paid under a RCBAP where a single unit in a condominium building is insured by both a Dwelling Policy and a RCBAP.
</P>
<P>c. Condominium Loss Assessment coverage does not increase the Coverage A Limit of Liability and is subject to the maximum coverage limits available for a single-family dwelling under the Act, payable between all policies issued and covering the unit, under the Act.
</P>
<HD2>D. Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance

<P>We will pay you up to $30,000 under this Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance, which only applies to policies with building coverage (Coverage A). Our payment of claims under Coverage D is in addition to the amount of coverage which you selected on the application and which appears on the Declarations Page. But the maximum you can collect under this policy for both Coverage A—Building Property and Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance cannot exceed the maximum permitted under the Act. We do not charge a separate deductible for a claim under Coverage D.
</P>
<HD3>3. Eligibility
</HD3>
<P>a. A building insured under Coverage A—Building Property sustaining a loss caused by a flood as defined by this policy must:
</P>
<P>(1) Be a “repetitive loss building.” A repetitive loss building is one that meets the following conditions:
</P>
<P>(a) The building is insured by a contract of flood insurance issued under the NFIP.
</P>
<P>(b) The building has suffered flood damage on two occasions during a 10-year period which ends on the date of the second loss.
</P>
<P>(c) The cost to repair the flood damage, on average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each flood loss.
</P>
<P>(d) In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must have paid the previous qualifying claim, and the State or community must have a cumulative, substantial damage provision or repetitive loss provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building; or
</P>
<P>(2) Be a building that has had flood damage in which the cost to repair equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building at the time of the flood. The State or community must have a substantial damage provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building.
</P>
<P>b. This Coverage D pays you to comply with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances that meet the minimum standards of the National Flood Insurance Program found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3. We pay for compliance activities that exceed those standards under these conditions:
</P>
<P>(1) 3.a.1 above.
</P>
<P>(2) Elevation or floodproofing in any risk zone to preliminary or advisory base flood elevations provided by FEMA which the State or local government has adopted and is enforcing for flood-damaged buildings in such areas. (This includes compliance activities in B, C, X, or D zones which are being changed to zones with base flood elevations. This also includes compliance activities in zones where base flood elevations are being increased, and a flood-damaged building must comply with the higher advisory base flood elevation.) Increased Cost of Compliance coverage does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D zones where the community has derived its own elevations and is enforcing elevation or floodproofing requirements for flood-damaged buildings to elevations derived solely by the community.
</P>
<P>(3) Elevation or floodproofing above the base flood elevation to meet State or local “free-board” requirements, <I>i.e.,</I> that a building must be elevated above the base flood elevation.
</P>
<P>c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(4), States and communities must require the elevation or floodproofing of buildings in unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation where elevation data is obtained from a Federal, State, or other source. Such compliance activities are eligible for Coverage D.
</P>
<P>d. Coverage D will pay for the incremental cost, after demolition or relocation, of elevating or floodproofing a building during its rebuilding at the same or another site to meet State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances, subject to Coverage D Exclusion 5.g below.
</P>
<P>e. Coverage D will pay to bring a flood-damaged building into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances even if the building had received a variance before the present loss from the applicable floodplain management requirements.
</P>
<HD3>4. Conditions
</HD3>
<P>a. When a building insured under Coverage A—Building Property sustains a loss caused by a flood, our payment for the loss under this Coverage D will be for the increased cost to elevate, floodproof, relocate, or demolish (or any combination of these activities) caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Our payment for eligible demolition activities will be for the cost to demolish and clear the site of the building debris or a portion thereof caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Eligible activities for the cost of clearing the site will include those necessary to discontinue utility service to the site and ensure proper abandonment of on-site utilities.
</P>
<P>b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be intended for the same occupancy as the present building unless otherwise required by current floodplain management ordinances or laws.
</P>
<HD3>5. Exclusions
</HD3>
<P>Under this Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance), we will not pay for:
</P>
<P>a. The cost to comply with any floodplain management law or ordinance in communities participating in the Emergency Program.
</P>
<P>b. The cost associated with enforcement of any ordinance or law that requires any insured or others to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way respond to, or assess the effects of pollutants.
</P>
<P>c. The loss in value to any insured building due to the requirements of any ordinance or law.
</P>
<P>d. The loss in residual value of the undamaged portion of a building demolished as a consequence of enforcement of any State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.
</P>
<P>e. Any Increased Cost of Compliance under this Coverage D:
</P>
<P>(1) Until the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated on the same or to another premises; and
</P>
<P>(2) Unless the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated as soon as reasonably possible after the loss, not to exceed two years.
</P>
<P>f. Any code upgrade requirements, <I>e.g.,</I> plumbing or electrical wiring, not specifically related to the State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.
</P>
<P>g. Any compliance activities needed to bring additions or improvements made after the loss occurred into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances.
</P>
<P>h. Loss due to any ordinance or law that you were required to comply with before the current loss.
</P>
<P>i. Any rebuilding activity to standards that do not meet the NFIP's minimum requirements. This includes any situation where the insured has received from the State or community a variance in connection with the current flood loss to rebuild the property to an elevation below the base flood elevation.
</P>
<P>j. Increased Cost of Compliance for a garage or carport.
</P>
<P>k. Any building insured under an NFIP Group Flood Insurance Policy.
</P>
<P>l. Assessments made by a condominium association on individual condominium unit owners to pay increased costs of repairing commonly owned buildings after a flood in compliance with State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws.
</P>
<HD3>6. Other Provisions
</HD3>
<P>a. Increased Cost of Compliance coverage will not be included in the calculation to determine whether coverage meets the 80 percent insurance-to-value requirement for replacement cost coverage as set forth in Art. VII.R (“Loss Settlement”) of this policy.
</P>
<P>b. All other conditions and provisions of this policy apply.
</P>
<HD1>IV. Property Not Insured

<P>We do not insure any of the following:
</P>
<P>1. Personal property not inside a building.

</P>
<P>11. Buildings or units and all their contents if more than 49 percent of the actual cash value of the building is below ground, unless the lowest level is at or above the base flood elevation and is below ground by reason of earth having been used as insulation material in conjunction with energy efficient building techniques.

</P>
<P>16. Personal property you own in common with other unit owners comprising the membership of a condominium association.
</P>
<HD1>V. Exclusions
</HD1>
<P>A. We only pay for direct physical loss by or from flood, which means that we do not pay you for:
</P>
<P>1. Loss of revenue or profits;
</P>
<P>2. Loss of access to the insured property or described location;
</P>
<P>3. Loss of use of the insured property or described location;

</P>
<P>B. <I>Flood in Progress.</I> If this policy became effective as of the time of a loan closing, as provided by 44 CFR 61.11(b), we will not pay for a loss caused by a flood that is a continuation of a flood that existed prior to coverage becoming effective. In all other circumstances, we will not pay for a loss caused by a flood that is a continuation of a flood that existed on or before the day you submitted the application for coverage under this policy and the full amount due. We will determine the date of application using 44 CFR 61.11(f).
</P>
<P>C. We do not insure for loss to property caused directly by earth movement even if the earth movement is caused by flood. Some examples of earth movement that we do not cover are:
</P>
<P>1. Earthquake;
</P>
<P>2. Landslide;
</P>
<P>3. Land subsidence;
</P>
<P>4. Sinkholes;
</P>
<P>5. Destabilization or movement of land that results from accumulation of water in subsurface land area; or
</P>
<P>6. Gradual erosion.
</P>
<P>We do, however, pay for losses from mudflow and land subsidence as a result of erosion that are specifically insured under our definition of flood (<I>see</I> II.B.1.c and II.B.2).
</P>
<P>D. We do not insure for direct physical loss caused directly or indirectly by any of the following:
</P>
<P>1. The pressure or weight of ice;
</P>
<P>2. Freezing or thawing;
</P>
<P>3. Rain, snow, sleet, hail, or water spray;

</P>
<FP>unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the sewer or drain backup, sump pump discharge or overflow, or the seepage of water;

<P>6. The pressure or weight of water unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the damage from the pressure or weight of water;
</P>
<P>7. Power, heating, or cooling failure unless the failure results from direct physical loss by or from flood to power, heating, or cooling equipment on the described location;
</P>
<P>8. Theft, fire, explosion, wind, or windstorm;
</P>
<P>9. Anything you or any member of your household do or conspire to do to deliberately cause loss by flood; or
</P>
<P>10. Alteration of the insured property that significantly increases the risk of flooding.
</P>
<P>E. We do not insure for loss to any building or personal property located on land leased from the Federal Government, arising from or incident to the flooding of the land by the Federal Government, where the lease expressly holds the Federal Government harmless under flood insurance issued under any Federal Government program.
</P>
<P>F. We do not pay for the testing for or monitoring of pollutants unless required by law or ordinance.
</P>
<HD1>VI. Deductibles
</HD1>
<P>A. When a loss is insured under this policy, we will pay only that part of the loss that exceeds your deductible amount, subject to the limit of liability that applies. The deductible amount is shown on the Declarations Page.
</P>
<P>However, when a building under construction, alteration, or repair does not have at least two rigid exterior walls and a fully secured roof at the time of loss, your deductible amount will be two times the deductible that would otherwise apply to a completed building.
</P>
<P>B. In each loss from flood, separate deductibles apply to the building and personal property insured by this policy.
</P>
<P>C. The deductible does NOT apply to:
</P>
<P>1. III.C.2. Loss Avoidance Measures;
</P>
<P>2. III.C.3. Condominium Loss Assessments; or
</P>
<P>3. III.D. Increased Cost of Compliance.
</P>
<HD1>VII. General Conditions
</HD1>
<HD2>A. Pair and Set Clause
</HD2>
<P>In case of loss to an article that is part of a pair or set, we will have the option of paying you:
</P>
<P>1. An amount equal to the cost of replacing the lost, damaged, or destroyed article, minus its depreciation; or
</P>
<P>2. The amount that represents the fair proportion of the total value of the pair or set that the lost, damaged, or destroyed article bears to the pair or set.
</P>
<HD2>B. Other Insurance
</HD2>
<P>1. If a loss insured by this policy is also insured by other insurance that includes flood coverage not issued under the Act, we will not pay more than the amount of insurance you are entitled to for lost, damaged, or destroyed property insured under this policy subject to the following:
</P>
<P>a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss, unless VII.B.1.b or c immediately below applies.
</P>
<P>b. If the other policy has a provision stating that it is excess insurance, this policy will be primary.
</P>
<P>c. This policy will be primary (but subject to its own deductible) up to the deductible in the other flood policy (except another policy as described in VII.B.1.b above). When the other deductible amount is reached, this policy will participate in the same proportion that the amount of insurance under this policy bears to the total amount of both policies, for the remainder of the loss.
</P>
<P>2. If there is other insurance issued under the Act in the name of your condominium association covering the same property insured by this policy, then this policy will be in excess over the other insurance, except where a condominium loss assessment to the unit owner results from a loss sustained by the condominium association that was not reimbursed under a flood insurance policy written in the name of the association under the Act because the building was not, at the time of loss, insured for an amount equal to the lesser of:
</P>
<P>a. 80 percent or more of its full replacement cost; or
</P>
<P>b. The maximum amount of insurance permitted under the Act.
</P>
<P>The combined coverage payment under the other NFIP insurance and this policy cannot exceed the maximum coverage available under the Act, of $250,000 per single unit.
</P>
<HD2>C. Amendments, Waivers, Assignment
</HD2>
<P>This policy cannot be changed, nor can any of its provisions be waived, without the express written consent of the Federal Insurance Administrator. No action we take under the terms of this policy constitutes a waiver of any of our rights. You may assign this policy in writing when you transfer title of your property to someone else except under these conditions:
</P>
<P>a. When this policy insures only personal property; or
</P>
<P>b. When this policy insures a building under construction.
</P>
<HD2>D. Insufficient Premium or Rating Information
</HD2>
<P>1. Applicability. The following provisions apply to all instances where the premium paid on this policy is insufficient or where the rating information is insufficient, such as where an Elevation Certificate is not provided.
</P>
<P>2. Reforming the Policy with Reduced Coverage. Except as otherwise provided in VII.D.1, if the premium we received from you was not sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will provide only the kinds and amounts of coverage that can be purchased for the premium payment we received.
</P>
<P>a. For the purpose of determining whether your premium payment is sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will first deduct the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges.
</P>
<P>b. If the amount paid, after deducting the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges, is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, your payment will be refunded. Unless the policy is reformed to increase the coverage amount to the amount originally requested pursuant to VII.D.3, this policy will be cancelled, and no claims will be paid under this policy.
</P>
<P>c. Coverage limits on the reformed policy will be based upon the amount of premium submitted per type of coverage, but will not exceed the amount originally requested.
</P>
<P>3. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Rating Information. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, the policy will be reformed as described in VII.D.2. You have the option of increasing the amount of coverage resulting from this reformation to the amount you requested as follows:
</P>
<P>a. Insufficient Premium. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will send you, and any mortgagee or trustee known to us, a bill for the required additional premium for the current policy term (or that portion of the current policy term following any endorsement changing the amount of coverage). If it is discovered that the initial amount charged to you for any fees or surcharges is incorrect, the difference will be added or deducted, as applicable, to the total amount in this bill.
</P>
<P>(1) If you or the mortgagee or trustee pays the additional premium amount due within 30 days from the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested amount, effective to the beginning of the current policy term (or subsequent date of any endorsement changing the amount of coverage).
</P>
<P>(2) If you or the mortgagee or trustee do not pay the additional amount due within 30 days of the date of our bill, any flood insurance claim will be settled based on the reduced amount of coverage.
</P>
<P>(3) As applicable, you have the option of paying all or part of the amount due out of a claim payment based on the originally requested amount of coverage.
</P>
<P>b. Insufficient Rating Information. If we determine that the rating information we have is insufficient and prevents us from calculating the additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information. You must submit the information within 60 days of our request.
</P>
<P>(1) If we receive the information within 60 days of our request, we will determine the amount of additional premium for the current policy term, and follow the procedure in VII.D.3.a above.
</P>
<P>(2) If we do not receive the information within 60 days of our request, no claims will be paid until the requested information is provided. Coverage will be limited to the amount of coverage that can be purchased for the payments we received, as determined when the requested information is provided.
</P>
<P>4. Coverage Increases. If we do not receive the amounts requested in VII.D.3.a or the additional information requested in VII.D.3.b by the date it is due, the amount of coverage under this policy can only be increased by endorsement subject to the appropriate waiting period. However, no coverage increases will be allowed until you have provided the information requested in VII.D.3.b.
</P>
<P>5. Falsifying Information. However, if we find that you or your agent intentionally did not tell us, or falsified any important fact or circumstance or did anything fraudulent relating to this insurance, the provisions of VIII.A apply.
</P>
<HD2>E. Policy Renewal
</HD2>
<P>1. This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the policy term.
</P>
<P>2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate renewal premium within 30 days of the expiration date.
</P>
<P>3. If we find, however, that we did not place your renewal notice into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we did mail it, we made a mistake, <I>e.g.,</I> we used an incorrect, incomplete, or illegible address, which delayed its delivery to you before the due date for the renewal premium, then we will follow these procedures:
</P>
<P>a. If you or your agent notified us, not later than one year after the date on which the payment of the renewal premium was due, of non-receipt of a renewal notice before the due date for the renewal premium, and we determine that the circumstances in the preceding paragraph apply, we will mail a second bill providing a revised due date, which will be 30 days after the date on which the bill is mailed.
</P>
<P>b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the second bill by the revised due date, then we will not renew the policy. In that case, the policy will remain an expired policy as of the expiration date shown on the Declarations Page.
</P>
<P>4. In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may ask you during the policy term to recertify, on a Recertification Questionnaire we will provide to you, the rating information used to rate your most recent application for or renewal of insurance.
</P>
<HD2>F. Conditions Suspending or Restricting Insurance
</HD2>
<P>We are not liable for loss that occurs while there is a hazard that is increased by any means within your control or knowledge.
</P>
<HD2>G. Requirements in Case of Loss
</HD2>
<P>In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:
</P>
<P>1. Give prompt written notice to us.
</P>
<P>2. As soon as reasonably possible, separate the damaged and undamaged property, putting it in the best possible order so that we may examine it.
</P>
<P>3. Prepare an inventory of damaged property showing the quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount of loss. Attach all bills, receipts, and related documents.
</P>
<P>4. Within 60 days after the loss, send us a proof of loss, which is your statement of the amount you are claiming under the policy signed and sworn to by you, and which furnishes us with the following information:
</P>
<P>a. The date and time of loss;
</P>
<P>b. A brief explanation of how the loss happened;
</P>
<P>c. Your interest (for example, “owner”) and the interest, if any, of others in the damaged property;
</P>
<P>d. Details of any other insurance that may cover the loss;
</P>
<P>e. Changes in title or occupancy of the insured property during the term of the policy;
</P>
<P>f. Specifications of damaged buildings and detailed repair estimates;
</P>
<P>g. Names of mortgagees or anyone else having a lien, charge, or claim against the insured property;
</P>
<P>h. Details about who occupied any insured building at the time of loss and for what purpose; and
</P>
<P>i. The inventory of damaged personal property described in G.3 above.
</P>
<P>5. In completing the proof of loss, you must use your own judgment concerning the amount of loss and justify that amount.
</P>
<P>6. You must cooperate with the adjuster or representative in the investigation of the claim.
</P>
<P>7. The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate your claim may furnish you with a proof of loss form, and she or he may help you complete it. However, this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must still send us a proof of loss within 60 days after the loss even if the adjuster does not furnish the form or help you complete it.
</P>
<P>8. We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or disapprove claims or to tell you whether we will approve your claim.
</P>
<P>9. At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of the loss instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's report will include information about your loss and the damages you sustained. You must sign the adjuster's report. At our option, we may require you to swear to the report.
</P>
<HD2>H. Our Options After a Loss
</HD2>
<P>Options we may, in our sole discretion, exercise after loss include the following:
</P>
<P>1. At such reasonable times and places that we may designate, you must:
</P>
<P>a. Show us or our representative the damaged property;
</P>
<P>b. Submit to examination under oath, while not in the presence of another insured, and sign the same; and
</P>
<P>c. Permit us to examine and make extracts and copies of:
</P>
<P>(1) Any policies of property insurance insuring you against loss and the deed establishing your ownership of the insured real property;
</P>
<P>(2) Condominium association documents including the Declarations of the condominium, its Articles of Association or Incorporation, Bylaws, rules and regulations, and other relevant documents if you are a unit owner in a condominium building; and
</P>
<P>(3) All books of accounts, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or certified copies pertaining to the damaged property if the originals are lost.
</P>
<P>2. We may request, in writing, that you furnish us with a complete inventory of the lost, damaged or destroyed property, including:
</P>
<P>a. Quantities and costs;
</P>
<P>b. Actual cash values or replacement cost (whichever is appropriate);
</P>
<P>c. Amounts of loss claimed;
</P>
<P>d. Any written plans and specifications for repair of the damaged property that you can reasonably make available to us; and
</P>
<P>e. Evidence that prior flood damage has been repaired.
</P>
<P>3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:
</P>
<P>a. Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property with material or property of like kind and quality or its functional equivalent; and
</P>
<P>b. Take all or any part of the damaged property at the value that we agree upon or its appraised value.
</P>
<HD2>I. No Benefit to Bailee
</HD2>
<P>No person or organization, other than you, having custody of insured property will benefit from this insurance.
</P>
<HD2>J. Loss Payment
</HD2>
<P>1. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some other person or entity is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. Loss will be payable 60 days after we receive your proof of loss (or within 90 days after the insurance adjuster files the adjuster's report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss) and:
</P>
<P>a. We reach an agreement with you;
</P>
<P>b. There is an entry of a final judgment; or
</P>
<P>c. There is a filing of an appraisal award with us, as provided in VII.M.
</P>
<P>2. If we reject your proof of loss in whole or in part you may:
</P>
<P>a. Accept our denial of your claim;
</P>
<P>b. Exercise your rights under this policy; or
</P>
<P>c. File an amended proof of loss as long as it is filed within 60 days of the date of the loss.
</P>
<HD2>K. Abandonment
</HD2>
<P>You may not abandon to us damaged or undamaged property insured under this policy.
</P>
<HD2>L. Salvage
</HD2>
<P>We may permit you to keep damaged property insured under this policy after a loss, and we will reduce the amount of the loss proceeds payable to you under the policy by the value of the salvage.
</P>
<HD2>M. Appraisal
</HD2>
<P>If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value or, if applicable, replacement cost of your damaged property to settle upon the amount of loss, then either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the insured property is located. The appraisers will separately state the actual cash value, the replacement cost, and the amount of loss to each item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of actual cash value and loss, or if it applies, the replacement cost and loss.
</P>
<P>Each party will:
</P>
<P>1. Pay its own appraiser; and
</P>
<P>2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.
</P>
<HD2>N. Mortgage Clause
</HD2>
<P>1. The word “mortgagee” includes trustee.
</P>
<P>2. Any loss payable under Coverage A—Building Property will be paid to any mortgagee of whom we have actual notice, as well as any other mortgagee or loss payee determined to exist at the time of loss, and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.
</P>
<P>3. If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:
</P>
<P>a. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or occupancy, or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware;
</P>
<P>b. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and
</P>
<P>c. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.
</P>
<P>4. All of the terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.
</P>
<P>5. The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building.
</P>
<P>6. If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will continue in effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 30 days after we notify the mortgagee of the cancellation or non-renewal.
</P>
<P>7. If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you, we are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's claim.
</P>
<HD2>O. Suit Against Us
</HD2>
<P>You may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you have complied with all the requirements of the policy. If you do sue, you must start the suit within one year after the date of the written denial of all or part of the claim, and you must file the suit in the United States District Court of the district in which the insured property was located at the time of loss. This requirement applies to any claim that you may have under this policy and to any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.
</P>
<HD2>P. Subrogation
</HD2>
<P>Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this policy, we are subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person. That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you may keep any of that money.
</P>
<HD2>Q. Continuous Lake Flooding
</HD2>
<P>1. If an insured building has been flooded by rising lake waters continuously for 90 days or more and it appears reasonably certain that a continuation of this flooding will result in an insured loss to the insured building equal to or greater than the building policy limits plus the deductible or the maximum payable under the policy for any one building loss, we will pay you the lesser of these two amounts without waiting for the further damage to occur if you sign a release agreeing:
</P>
<P>a. To make no further claim under this policy;
</P>
<P>b. Not to seek renewal of this policy;
</P>
<P>c. Not to apply for any flood insurance under the Act for property at the described location;
</P>
<P>d. Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior terms.
</P>
<P>If the policy term ends before the insured building has been flooded continuously for 90 days, the provisions of this paragraph Q.1 will apply when the insured building suffers a covered loss before the policy term ends.
</P>
<P>2. If your insured building is subject to continuous lake flooding from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file a claim under either paragraph Q.1 above or Q.2 (A “closed basin lake” is a natural lake from which water leaves primarily through evaporation and whose surface area now exceeds or has exceeded one square mile at any time in the recorded past. Most of the nation's closed basin lakes are in the western half of the United States where annual evaporation exceeds annual precipitation and where lake levels and surface areas are subject to considerable fluctuation due to wide variations in the climate. These lakes may overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under this paragraph Q.2, we will pay your claim as if the building is a total loss even though it has not been continuously inundated for 90 days, subject to the following conditions:
</P>
<P>a. Lake floodwaters must damage or imminently threaten to damage your building.
</P>
<P>b. Before approval of your claim, you must:
</P>
<P>(1) Agree to a claim payment that reflects your buying back the salvage on a negotiated basis; and
</P>
<P>(2) Grant the conservation easement described in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes” to be recorded in the office of the local recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with the community in which the property is located, will identify on a map an area or areas of special consideration (ASC) in which there is a potential for flood damage from continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the community the agreed-upon map showing the ASC. This easement will only apply to that portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow certain agricultural and recreational uses of the land. The only structures it will allow on any portion of the property within the ASC are certain simple agricultural and recreational structures. If any of these allowable structures are insurable buildings under the NFIP and are insured under the NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits of this paragraph Q.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers certified flood control project or otherwise certified flood control project later protects the property, FEMA will, upon request, amend the ASC to remove areas protected by those projects. The restrictions of the easement will then no longer apply to any portion of the property removed from the ASC; and
</P>
<P>(3) Comply with paragraphs Q.1.a through Q.1.d above.
</P>
<P>c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must move your building to a new location outside the ASC. FEMA will give you an additional 30 days to move if you show there is sufficient reason to extend the time.
</P>
<P>d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must acquire an elevation certificate and a floodplain development permit from the local floodplain administrator for the new location of your building.
</P>
<P>e. Before the approval of your claim, the community having jurisdiction over your building must:
</P>
<P>(1) Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a temporary moratorium for a period not to exceed 6 months to be followed immediately by a permanent land use ordinance that is consistent with the provisions specified in the easement required in paragraph Q.2.b above;
</P>
<P>(2) Agree to declare and report any violations of this ordinance to FEMA so that under Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, flood insurance to the building can be denied; and
</P>
<P>(3) Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for purposes compatible with open space or agricultural or recreational use only, any affected property the community acquires an interest in. These deed restrictions must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q.2.b above, except that, even if a certified project protects the property, the land use restrictions continue to apply if the property was acquired under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. If a non-profit land trust organization receives the property as a donation, that organization must maintain the property as deed-restricted, consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q2.b above.
</P>
<P>f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected State must take all action set forth in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes.”
</P>
<P>g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage continuously in effect from a date established by FEMA until you file a claim under paragraph Q.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance that goes into effect within 60 days of the date of transfer of title, any gap in coverage during that 60-day period will not be a violation of this continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose of honoring a claim under this paragraph Q.2, we will not consider to be in effect any increased coverage that became effective after the date established by FEMA. The exception to this is any in-creased coverage in the amount suggested by your insurer as an inflation adjustment.
</P>
<P>h. This paragraph Q.2 will be in effect for a community when the FEMA Regional Administrator for the affected region provides to the community, in writing, the following:
</P>
<P>(1) Confirmation that the community and the State are in compliance with the conditions in paragraphs Q.2.e and Q.2.f above; and
</P>
<P>(2) The date by which you must have flood insurance in effect.
</P>
<HD2>R. Loss Settlement
</HD2>
<HD3>1. Introduction
</HD3>
<P>This policy provides three methods of settling losses: Replacement Cost, Special Loss Settlement, and Actual Cash Value. Each method is used for a different type of property, as explained in paragraphs a-c below.
</P>
<P>a. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement, described in R.2 below, applies to a single-family dwelling provided:
</P>
<P>(1) It is your principal residence; and
</P>
<P>(2) At the time of loss, the amount of insurance in this policy that applies to the dwelling is 80 percent or more of its full replacement cost immediately before the loss, or is the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP.
</P>
<P>b. Special Loss Settlement, described in R.3 below, applies to a single-family dwelling that is a manufactured or mobile home or a travel trailer.
</P>
<P>c. Actual Cash Value Loss Settlement applies to a single-family dwelling not subject to replacement cost or special loss settlement, and to the property listed in R.4 below.
</P>
<HD3>2. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement
</HD3>
<P>The following loss settlement conditions apply to a single-family dwelling described in R.1.a above:
</P>
<P>a. We will pay to repair or replace the damaged dwelling after application of the deductible and without deduction for depreciation, but not more than the least of the following amounts:
</P>
<P>(1) The building limit of liability shown on your Declarations Page;
</P>
<P>(2) The replacement cost of that part of the dwelling damaged, with materials of like kind and quality and for like use; or
</P>
<P>(3) The necessary amount actually spent to repair or replace the damaged part of the dwelling for like use.
</P>
<P>b. If the dwelling is rebuilt at a new location, the cost described above is limited to the cost that would have been incurred if the dwelling had been rebuilt at its former location.
</P>
<P>c. When the full cost of repair or replacement is more than $1,000, or more than 5 percent of the whole amount of insurance that applies to the dwelling, we will not be liable for any loss under R.2.a above or R.4.a.2 below unless and until actual repair or replacement is completed.
</P>
<P>d. You may disregard the replacement cost conditions above and make claim under this policy for loss to dwellings on an actual cash value basis. You may then make claim for any additional liability according to R.2.a, b, and c above, provided you notify us of your intent to do so within 180 days after the date of loss.
</P>
<P>e. If the community in which your dwelling is located has been converted from the Emergency Program to the Regular Program during the current policy term, then we will consider the maximum amount of available NFIP insurance to be the amount that was available at the beginning of the current policy term.
</P>
<HD3>3. Special Loss Settlement
</HD3>
<P>a. The following loss settlement conditions apply to a single-family dwelling that:
</P>
<P>(1) is a manufactured or mobile home or a travel trailer, as defined in II.C.6.b and c;
</P>
<P>(2) is at least 16 feet wide when fully assembled and has an area of at least 600 square feet within its perimeter walls when fully assembled; and
</P>
<P>(3) is your principal residence as specified in R.1.a.1 above.
</P>
<P>b. If such a dwelling is totally destroyed or damaged to such an extent that, in our judgment, it is not economically feasible to repair, at least to its pre-damage condition, we will, at our discretion pay the least of the following amounts:
</P>
<P>(1) The lesser of the replacement cost of the dwelling or 1.5 times the actual cash value; or
</P>
<P>(2) The building limit of liability shown on your Declarations Page.
</P>
<P>c. If such a dwelling is partially damaged and, in our judgment, it is economically feasible to repair it to its pre-damage condition, we will settle the loss according to the Replacement Cost conditions in R.2 above.
</P>
<HD3>4. Actual Cash Value Loss Settlement
</HD3>
<P>The types of property noted below are subject to actual cash value (or in the case of R.4.a.2., below, proportional) loss settlement.
</P>
<P>a. A dwelling, at the time of loss, when the amount of insurance on the dwelling is both less than 80 percent of its full replacement cost immediately before the loss and less than the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP. In that case, we will pay the greater of the following amounts, but not more than the amount of insurance that applies to that dwelling:
</P>
<P>(1) The actual cash value, as defined in II.C.2, of the damaged part of the dwelling; or
</P>
<P>(2) A proportion of the cost to repair or replace the damaged part of the dwelling, without deduction for physical depreciation and after application of the deductible.
</P>
<P>This proportion is determined as follows: If 80 percent of the full replacement cost of the dwelling is less than the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP, then the proportion is determined by dividing the actual amount of insurance on the dwelling by the amount of insurance that represents 80 percent of its full replacement cost. But if 80 percent of the full replacement cost of the dwelling is greater than the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP, then the proportion is determined by dividing the actual amount of insurance on the dwelling by the maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP.
</P>
<P>b. A two-, three-, or four-family dwelling.
</P>
<P>c. A unit that is not used exclusively for single-family dwelling purposes.
</P>
<P>d. Detached garages.
</P>
<P>e. Personal property.
</P>
<P>f. Appliances, carpets, and carpet pads.
</P>
<P>g. Outdoor awnings, outdoor antennas or aerials of any type, and other outdoor equipment.
</P>
<P>h. Any property insured under this policy that is abandoned after a loss and remains as debris anywhere on the described location.
</P>
<P>i. A dwelling that is not your principal residence.
</P>
<HD3>5. Amount of Insurance Required
</HD3>
<P>To determine the amount of insurance required for a dwelling immediately before the loss, we do not include the value of:
</P>
<P>a. Footings, foundations, piers, or any other structures or devices that are below the undersurface of the lowest basement floor and support all or part of the dwelling;
</P>
<P>b. Those supports listed in R.5.a above, that are below the surface of the ground inside the foundation walls if there is no basement; and
</P>
<P>c. Excavations and underground flues, pipes, wiring, and drains.
</P>
<P><I>Note:</I> The Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance limit of liability is not included in the determination of the amount of insurance required.
</P>
<HD1>VIII. Policy Nullification, Cancellation, and Non-Renewal
</HD1>
<HD2>A. Policy Nullification for Fraud, Misrepresentation, or Making False Statements
</HD2>
<P>1. With respect to all insureds under this policy, this policy is void and has no legal force and effect if at any time, before or after a loss, you or any other insured or your agent have, with respect to this policy or any other NFIP insurance:
</P>
<P>a. Concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance;
</P>
<P>b. Engaged in fraudulent conduct; or
</P>
<P>c. Made false statements.
</P>
<P>2. Policies voided under A.1 cannot be renewed or replaced by a new NFIP policy.
</P>
<P>3. Policies are void as of the date the acts described in A.1 above were committed.
</P>
<P>4. Fines, civil penalties, and imprisonment under applicable Federal laws may also apply to the acts of fraud or concealment described above.
</P>
<HD2>B. Policy Nullification for Reasons Other Than Fraud
</HD2>
<P>1. This policy is void from its inception, and has no legal force or effect, if:
</P>
<P>a. The property listed on the application is located in a community that was not participating in the NFIP on this policy's inception date and did not join or reenter the program during the policy term and before the loss occurred;
</P>
<P>b. The property listed on the application is otherwise not eligible for coverage under the NFIP at the time of the initial application;
</P>
<P>c. You never had an insurable interest in the property listed on the application;
</P>
<P>d. You provided an agent with an application and payment, but the payment did not clear; or
</P>
<P>e. We receive notice from you, prior to the policy effective date, that you have determined not to take the policy and you are not subject to a requirement to obtain and maintain flood insurance pursuant to any statute, regulation, or contract.
</P>
<P>2. In such cases, you will be entitled to a full refund of all premium, fees, and surcharges received. However, if a claim was paid for a policy that is void, the claim payment must be returned to FEMA or offset from the premiums to be refunded before the refund will be processed.
</P>
<HD2>C. Cancellation of the Policy by You
</HD2>
<P>1. You may cancel this policy in accordance with the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.
</P>
<P>2. If you cancel this policy, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium, surcharges, or fees under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.
</P>
<HD2>D. Cancellation of the Policy by Us
</HD2>
<P>1. Cancellation for Underpayment of Amounts Owed on Policy. This policy will be cancelled, pursuant to VII.D.2, if it is determined that the premium amount you paid is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, and you do not pay the additional amount of premium owed to increase the coverage to the originally requested amount within the required time period.
</P>
<P>2. Cancellation Due to Lack of an Insurable Interest.
</P>
<P>a. If you no longer have an insurable interest in the insured property, we will cancel this policy. You will cease to have an insurable interest if:
</P>
<P>(1) For building coverage, the building was sold, destroyed, or removed.
</P>
<P>(2) For contents coverage, the contents were sold or transferred ownership, or the contents were completely removed from the described location.
</P>
<P>b. If your policy is cancelled for this reason, you may be entitled to a partial refund of premium under the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.
</P>
<P>3. Cancellation of Duplicate Policies
</P>
<P>a. Except as allowed under Article I.G, your property may not be insured by more than one NFIP policy, and payment for damages to your property will only be made under one policy.
</P>
<P>b. Except as allowed under Article I.G, if the property is insured by more than one NFIP policy, we will cancel all but one of the policies. The policy, or policies, will be selected for cancellation in accordance with 44 CFR 62.5 and the applicable rules and guidance of the NFIP.
</P>
<P>c. If this policy is cancelled pursuant to VIII.D.3.b, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium, surcharges, or fees under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.
</P>

</P>
<P>b. If your policy is cancelled for this reason, you may be entitled to a partial refund of premium under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.
</P>
<HD2>E. Non-Renewal of the Policy by Us
</HD2>
<P>Your policy will not be renewed if:
</P>
<P>1. The community where your insured property is located is suspended or stops participating in the NFIP;
</P>
<P>2. Your building is otherwise ineligible for flood insurance under the Act;
</P>
<P>3. You have failed to provide the information we requested for the purpose of rating the policy within the required deadline.
</P>
<HD1>IX. Liberalization Clause
</HD1>
<P>If we make a change that broadens your coverage under this edition of our policy, but does not require any additional premium, then that change will automatically apply to your insurance as of the date we implement the change, provided that this implementation date falls within 60 days before or during the policy term stated on the Declarations Page.
</P>
<HD1>X. What Law Governs
</HD1>
<P>This policy and all disputes arising from the insurer's policy issuance, policy administration, or the handling of any claim under the policy are governed exclusively by the flood insurance regulations issued by FEMA, the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4001, <I>et seq.</I>), and Federal common law.

</P>
<HD1>I. Agreement
</HD1>
<P>A. Coverage Under This Policy
</P>
<P>1. Except as provided in I.A.2, this policy provides coverage for multifamily buildings (residential buildings designed for use by 5 or more families that are not condominium buildings), non-residential buildings, and their contents.
</P>
<P>2. There is no coverage for a residential condominium building in a regular program community, except for personal property coverage for a unit in a condominium building.
</P>
<P>B. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides flood insurance under the terms of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and its amendments, and Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
</P>
<P>C. We will pay you for direct physical loss by or from flood to your insured property if you:
</P>
<P>1. Have paid the full amount due (including applicable premiums, surcharges, and fees);
</P>
<P>2. Comply with all terms and conditions of this policy; and

<HD2>D. Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance
</HD2>
<HD3>1. General
</HD3>
<P>This policy pays you to comply with a State or local floodplain management law or ordinance affecting repair or reconstruction of a building suffering flood damage. Compliance activities eligible for payment are: elevation, floodproofing, relocation, or demolition (or any combination of these activities) of your building. Eligible floodproofing activities are limited to:
</P>
<P>a. Non-residential buildings.
</P>
<P>b. Residential buildings with basements that satisfy FEMA's standards published in the Code of Federal Regulations [44 CFR 60.6(b) or (c)].
</P>
<HD3>2. Limits of Liability
</HD3>
<P>We will pay you up to $30,000 under this Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance), which only applies to policies with building coverage (Coverage A). Our payment of claims under Coverage D is in addition to the amount of coverage which you selected on the application and which appears on the Declarations Page. However, the maximum you can collect under this policy for both Coverage A (Building Property) and Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance) cannot exceed the maximum permitted under the Act. We do NOT charge a separate deductible for a claim under Coverage D.
</P>
<HD3>3. Eligibility
</HD3>
<P>a. A building insured under Coverage A (Building Property) sustaining a loss caused by a flood as defined by this policy must:
</P>
<P>(1) Be a “repetitive loss building.” A repetitive loss building is one that meets the following conditions:
</P>
<P>(a) The building is insured by a contract of flood insurance issued under the NFIP.
</P>
<P>(b) The building has suffered flood damage on two occasions during a 10-year period which ends on the date of the second loss.
</P>
<P>(c) The cost to repair the flood damage, on average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each flood loss.
</P>
<P>(d) In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must have paid the previous qualifying claim, and the State or community must have a cumulative, substantial damage provision or repetitive loss provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building; or
</P>
<P>(2) Be a building that has had flood damage in which the cost to repair equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building at the time of the flood. The State or community must have a substantial damage provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building.
</P>
<P>b. This Coverage D pays you to comply with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances that meet the minimum standards of the National Flood Insurance Program found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3. We pay for compliance activities that exceed those standards under these conditions:
</P>
<P>(1) 3.a.1 above.
</P>
<P>(2) Elevation or floodproofing in any risk zone to preliminary or advisory base flood elevations provided by FEMA which the State or local government has adopted and is enforcing for flood-damaged buildings in such areas. (This includes compliance activities in B, C, X, or D zones which are being changed to zones with base flood elevations. This also includes compliance activities in zones where base flood elevations are being increased, and a flood-damaged building must comply with the higher advisory base flood elevation.) Increased Cost of Compliance coverage does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D zones where the community has derived its own elevations and is enforcing elevation or floodproofing requirements for flood-damaged buildings to elevations derived solely by the community.
</P>
<P>(3) Elevation or floodproofing above the base flood elevation to meet State or local “free-board” requirements, <I>i.e.,</I> that a building must be elevated above the base flood elevation.
</P>
<P>c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(4), States and communities must require the elevation or floodproofing of buildings in unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation where elevation data is obtained from a Federal, State, or other source. Such compliance activities are also eligible for Coverage D.
</P>
<P>d. This coverage will pay for the incremental cost, after demolition or relocation, of elevating or floodproofing a building during its rebuilding at the same or another site to meet State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances, subject to the exclusion at III.D.5.g.
</P>
<P>e. This coverage will pay to bring a flood-damaged building into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances even if the building had received a variance before the present loss from the applicable floodplain management requirements.
</P>
<HD3>4. Conditions
</HD3>
<P>a. When a building insured under Coverage A—Building Property sustains a loss caused by a flood, our payment for the loss under this Coverage D will be for the increased cost to elevate, floodproof, relocate, or demolish (or any combination of these activities) caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Our payment for eligible demolition activities will be for the cost to demolish and clear the site of the building debris or a portion thereof caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Eligible activities for the cost of clearing the site will include those necessary to discontinue utility service to the site and ensure proper abandonment of on-site utilities.
</P>
<P>b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be intended for the same occupancy as the present building unless otherwise required by current floodplain management ordinances or laws.
</P>
<HD3>5. Exclusions

</P>
<P>(2) Unless the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated as soon as reasonably possible after the loss, not to exceed two years.
</P>
<P>f. Any code upgrade requirements, <I>e.g.,</I> plumbing or electrical wiring, not specifically related to the State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.
</P>
<P>g. Any compliance activities needed to bring additions or improvements made after the loss occurred into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances.
</P>
<P>h. Loss due to any ordinance or law that you were required to comply with before the current loss.
</P>
<P>i. Any rebuilding activity to standards that do not meet the NFIP's minimum requirements. This includes any situation where the insured has received from the State or community a variance in connection with the current flood loss to rebuild the property to an elevation below the base flood elevation.
</P>
<P>j. Increased Cost of Compliance for a garage or carport.
</P>
<P>k. Any building insured under an NFIP Group Flood Insurance Policy.

<P>6. The cost of complying with any ordinance or law requiring or regulating the construction, demolition, remodeling, renovation, or repair of property, including removal of any resulting debris. This exclusion does not apply to any eligible activities we describe in Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance; or
</P>
<P>7. Any other economic loss you suffer.
</P>
<P>B. <I>Flood in Progress.</I> If this policy became effective as of the time of a loan closing, as provided by 44 CFR 61.11(b), we will not pay for a loss caused by a flood that is a continuation of a flood that existed prior to coverage becoming effective. In all other circumstances, we will not pay for a loss caused by a flood that is a continuation of a flood that existed on or before the day you submitted the application for coverage under this policy and the correct premium. We will determine the date of application using 44 CFR 611.11(f).
</P>
<P>C. We do not insure for loss to property caused directly by earth movement even if the earth movement is caused by flood. Some examples of earth movement that we do not cover are:
</P>
<P>1. Earthquake;
</P>
<P>2. Landslide;
</P>
<P>3. Land subsidence;
</P>
<P>4. Sinkholes;
</P>
<P>5. Destabilization or movement of land that results from accumulation of water in subsurface land areas; or
</P>
<P>6. Gradual erosion.
</P>
<P>We do, however, pay for losses from mudflow and land subsidence as a result of erosion that are specifically insured under our definition of flood (<I>see</I> II.B.1.c and II.B.2).
</P>
<P>D. We do not insure for direct physical loss caused directly or indirectly by:
</P>
<P>1. The pressure or weight of ice;
</P>
<P>2. Freezing or thawing;
</P>
<P>3. Rain, snow, sleet, hail, or water spray;
</P>
<P>4. Water, moisture, mildew, or mold damage that results primarily from any condition:
</P>
<P>a. Substantially confined to the insured building; or
</P>
<P>b. That is within your control including, but not limited to:
</P>
<P>(1) Design, structural, or mechanical defects;
</P>
<P>(2) Failures, stoppages, or breakage of water or sewer lines, drains, pumps, fixtures, or equipment; or
</P>
<P>(3) Failure to inspect and maintain the property after a flood recedes;
</P>
<P>5. Water or water-borne material that:
</P>
<P>a. Backs up through sewers or drains;
</P>
<P>b. Discharges or overflows from a sump, sump pump, or related equipment; or
</P>
<P>c. Seeps or leaks on or through the insured property;
</P>
<P>unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the sewer or drain backup, sump pump discharge or overflow, or the seepage of water;
</P>
<P>6. The pressure or weight of water unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the damage from the pressure or weight of water;
</P>
<P>7. Power, heating, or cooling failure unless the failure results from direct physical loss by or from flood to power, heating, or cooling equipment on the described location;
</P>
<P>8. Theft, fire, explosion, wind, or windstorm;
</P>
<P>9. Anything you or any member of your household do or conspires to do to deliberately cause loss by flood; or
</P>
<P>10. Alteration of the insured property that significantly increases the risk of flooding.
</P>
<P>E. We do not insure for loss to any building or personal property located on land leased from the Federal Government, arising from or incident to the flooding of the land by the Federal Government, where the lease expressly holds the Federal Government harmless under flood insurance issued under any Federal Government program.
</P>
<HD1>VI. Deductibles
</HD1>
<P>A. When a loss is insured under this policy, we will pay only that part of the loss that exceeds your deductible amount, subject to the limit of liability that applies. The deductible amount is shown on the Declarations Page.
</P>
<P>However, when a building under construction, alteration, or repair does not have at least two rigid exterior walls and a fully secured roof at the time of loss, your deductible amount will be two times the deductible that would otherwise apply to a completed building.
</P>
<P>B. In each loss from flood, separate deductibles apply to the building and personal property insured by this policy.
</P>
<P>C. The deductible does NOT apply to:
</P>
<P>1. III.C.2. Loss Avoidance Measures; or
</P>
<P>2. III.D. Increased Cost of Compliance.
</P>
<HD1>VII. General Conditions
</HD1>
<HD2>A. Pair and Set Clause
</HD2>
<P>In case of loss to an article that is part of a pair or set, we will have the option of paying you:
</P>
<P>1. An amount equal to the cost of replacing the lost, damaged, or destroyed article, minus its depreciation; or
</P>
<P>2. The amount that represents the fair proportion of the total value of the pair or set that the lost, damaged, or destroyed article bears to the pair or set.
</P>
<HD2>B. Other Insurance
</HD2>
<P>1. If a loss insured by this policy is also insured by other insurance that includes flood coverage not issued under the Act, we will not pay more than the amount of insurance that you are entitled to for lost, damaged, or destroyed property insured under this policy subject to the following:
</P>
<P>a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss, unless VII.B.1.b or c below applies.
</P>
<P>b. If the other policy has a provision stating that it is excess insurance, this policy will be primary.
</P>
<P>c. This policy will be primary (but subject to its own deductible) up to the deductible in the other flood policy (except another policy as described in VII.B.1.b above). When the other deductible amount is reached, this policy will participate in the same proportion that the amount of insurance under this policy bears to the total amount of both policies, for the remainder of the loss.
</P>
<P>2. Where this policy insures a condominium association and there is a National Flood Insurance Program flood insurance policy in the name of a unit owner that insures the same loss as this policy, then this policy will be primary.
</P>
<HD2>C. Amendments, Waivers, Assignment
</HD2>
<P>This policy cannot be changed, nor can any of its provisions be waived, without the express written consent of the Federal Insurance Administrator. No action that we take under the terms of this policy can constitute a waiver of any of our rights. You may assign this policy in writing when you transfer title of your property to someone else except under these conditions:
</P>
<P>1. When this policy insures only personal property; or
</P>
<P>2. When this policy insures a building under construction.
</P>
<HD2>D. Insufficient Premium or Rating Information
</HD2>
<P>1. Applicability. The following provisions apply to all instances where the premium paid on this policy is insufficient or where the rating information is insufficient, such as where an Elevation Certificate is not provided.
</P>
<P>2. Reforming the Policy with Reduced Coverage. Except as otherwise provided in VII.D.1 and VII.D.4, if the premium we received from you was not sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will provide only the kinds and amounts of coverage that can be purchased for the premium payment we received.
</P>
<P>a. For the purpose of determining whether your premium payment is sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will first deduct the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges.
</P>
<P>b. If the amount paid, after deducting the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges, is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, your payment will be refunded. Unless the policy is reformed to increase the coverage amount to the amount originally requested pursuant to VII.D.3, this policy will be cancelled, and no claims will be paid under this policy.
</P>
<P>c. Coverage limits on the reformed policy will be based upon the amount of premium submitted per type of coverage, but will not exceed the amount originally requested.
</P>
<P>3. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Rating Information. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, the policy will be reformed as described in VII.D.2. You have the option of increasing the amount of coverage resulting from this reformation to the amount you requested as follows:
</P>
<P>a. Insufficient Premium. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will send you, and any mortgagee or trustee known to us, a bill for the required additional premium for the current policy term (or that portion of the current policy term following any endorsement changing the amount of coverage). If it is discovered that the initial amount charged to you for any fees or surcharges is incorrect, the difference will be added or deducted, as applicable, to the total amount in this bill.
</P>
<P>(1) If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional amount due within 30 days from the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested amount, effective to the beginning of the current policy term (or subsequent date of any endorsement changing the amount of coverage).
</P>
<P>(2) If you or the mortgagee or trustee do not pay the additional amount due within 30 days of the date of our bill, any flood insurance claim will be settled based on the reduced amount of coverage.
</P>
<P>(3) As applicable, you have the option of paying all or part of the amount due out of a claim payment based on the originally requested amount of coverage.
</P>
<P>b. Insufficient Rating Information. If we determine that the rating information we have is insufficient and prevents us from calculating the additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information. You must submit the information within 60 days of our request.
</P>
<P>(1) If we receive the information within 60 days of our request, we will determine the amount of additional premium for the current policy term and follow the procedure in VII.D.3.a above.
</P>
<P>(2) If we do not receive the information within 60 days of our request, no claims will be paid until the requested information is provided. Coverage will be limited to the amount of coverage that can be purchased for the payments we received, as determined when the requested information is provided.
</P>
<P>4. Coverage Increases. If we do not receive the amounts requested in VII.D.3.a or the additional information requested in VII.D.3.b by the date it is due, the amount of coverage under this policy can only be increased by endorsement subject to the appropriate waiting period. However, no coverage increases will be allowed until you have provided the information requested in VII.D.3.b is provided.
</P>
<P>5. Falsifying Information. However, if we find that you or your agent intentionally did not tell us, or falsified, any important fact or circumstance or did anything fraudulent relating to this insurance, the provisions of VIII.A apply.
</P>
<HD2>E. Policy Renewal
</HD2>
<P>1. This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the policy term.
</P>
<P>2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate renewal premium within 30 days of the expiration date.
</P>
<P>3. If we find, however, that we did not place your renewal notice into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we did mail it, we made a mistake, <I>e.g.,</I> we used an incorrect, incomplete, or illegible address, which delayed its delivery to you before the due date for the renewal premium, then we will follow these procedures:
</P>
<P>a. If you or your agent notified us, not later than one year after the date on which the payment of the renewal premium was due, of non-receipt of a renewal notice before the due date for the renewal premium, and we determine that the circumstances in the preceding paragraph apply, we will mail a second bill providing a revised due date, which will be 30 days after the date on which the bill is mailed.
</P>
<P>b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the second bill by the revised due date, then we will not renew the policy. In that case, the policy will remain as an expired policy as of the expiration date shown on the Declarations Page.
</P>
<P>4. In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may ask you during the policy term to recertify, on a Recertification Questionnaire that we will provide to you, the rating information used to rate your most recent application for or renewal of insurance.
</P>
<HD2>F. Conditions Suspending or Restricting Insurance
</HD2>
<P>We are not liable for loss that occurs while there is a hazard that is increased by any means within your control or knowledge.
</P>
<HD2>G. Requirements in Case of Loss
</HD2>
<P>In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:
</P>
<P>1. Give prompt written notice to us.
</P>
<P>2. As soon as reasonably possible, separate the damaged and undamaged property, putting it in the best possible order so that we may examine it.
</P>
<P>3. Prepare an inventory of damaged property showing the quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount of loss. Attach all bills, receipts, and related documents.
</P>
<P>4. Within 60 days after the loss, send us a proof of loss, which is your statement of the amount you are claiming under the policy signed and sworn to by you, and which furnishes us with the following information:
</P>
<P>a. The date and time of loss;
</P>
<P>b. A brief explanation of how the loss happened;
</P>
<P>c. Your interest (for example, “owner”) and the interest, if any, of others in the damaged property;
</P>
<P>d. Details of any other insurance that may cover the loss;
</P>
<P>e. Changes in title or occupancy of the insured property during the term of the policy;
</P>
<P>f. Specifications of damaged buildings and detailed repair estimates;
</P>
<P>g. Names of mortgagees or anyone else having a lien, charge, or claim against the insured property;
</P>
<P>h. Details about who occupied any insured building at the time of loss and for what purpose; and
</P>
<P>i. The inventory of damaged personal property described in G.3 above.
</P>
<P>5. In completing the proof of loss, you must use your own judgment concerning the amount of loss and justify that amount.
</P>
<P>6. You must cooperate with the adjuster or representative in the investigation of the claim.
</P>
<P>7. The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate your claim may furnish you with a proof of loss form, and she or he may help you complete it. However, this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must still send us a proof of loss within 60 days after the loss even if the adjuster does not furnish the form or help you complete it.
</P>
<P>8. We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or disapprove claims or to tell you whether we will approve your claim.
</P>
<P>9. At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of the loss instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's report will include information about your loss and the damages you sustained. You must sign the adjuster's report. At our option, we may require you to swear to the report.
</P>
<HD2>H. Our Options After a Loss
</HD2>
<P>Options we may, in our sole discretion, exercise after loss include the following:
</P>
<P>1. At such reasonable times and places that we may designate, you must:
</P>
<P>a. Show us or our representative the damaged property;
</P>
<P>b. Submit to examination under oath, while not in the presence of another insured, and sign the same; and
</P>
<P>c. Permit us to examine and make extracts and copies of:
</P>
<P>(1) Any policies of property insurance insuring you against loss and the deed establishing your ownership of the insured real property;
</P>
<P>(2) Condominium association documents including the Declarations of the condominium, its Articles of Association or Incorporation, Bylaws, rules and regulations, and other relevant documents if you are a unit owner in a condominium building; and
</P>
<P>(3) All books of accounts, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or certified copies pertaining to the damaged property if the originals are lost.
</P>
<P>2. We may request, in writing, that you furnish us with a complete inventory of the lost, damaged or destroyed property, including:
</P>
<P>a. Quantities and costs;
</P>
<P>b. Actual cash values or replacement cost (whichever is appropriate);
</P>
<P>c. Amounts of loss claimed;
</P>
<P>d. Any written plans and specifications for repair of the damaged property that you can reasonably make available to us; and
</P>
<P>e. Evidence that prior flood damage has been repaired.
</P>
<P>3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:
</P>
<P>a. Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property with material or property of like kind and quality or its functional equivalent; and
</P>
<P>b. Take all or any part of the damaged property at the value that we agree upon or its appraised value.
</P>
<HD2>I. No Benefit to Bailee
</HD2>
<P>No person or organization, other than you, having custody of insured property will benefit from this insurance.
</P>
<HD2>J. Loss Payment
</HD2>
<P>1. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some other person or entity is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. Loss will be payable 60 days after we receive your proof of loss (or within 90 days after the insurance adjuster files the adjuster's report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss) and:
</P>
<P>a. We reach an agreement with you;
</P>
<P>b. There is an entry of a final judgment; or
</P>
<P>c. There is a filing of an appraisal award with us, as provided in VII.M.
</P>
<P>2. If we reject your proof of loss in whole or in part you may:
</P>
<P>a. Accept our denial of your claim;
</P>
<P>b. Exercise your rights under this policy; or
</P>
<P>c. File an amended proof of loss as long as it is filed within 60 days of the date of the loss.
</P>
<HD2>K. Abandonment
</HD2>
<P>You may not abandon damaged or undamaged insured property to us.
</P>
<HD2>L. Salvage
</HD2>
<P>We may permit you to keep damaged insured property after a loss, and we will reduce the amount of the loss proceeds payable to you under the policy by the value of the salvage.
</P>
<HD2>M. Appraisal
</HD2>
<P>If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value of the damaged property so as to determine the amount of loss, either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the insured property is located. The appraisers will separately state the actual cash value and the amount of loss to each item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of actual cash value and loss.
</P>
<P>Each party will:
</P>
<P>1. Pay its own appraiser; and
</P>
<P>2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.
</P>
<HD2>N. Mortgage Clause
</HD2>
<P>1. The word “mortgagee” includes trustee.
</P>
<P>2. Any loss payable under Coverage A—Building Property will be paid to any mortgagee of whom we have actual notice, as well as any other mortgagee or loss payee determined to exist at the time of loss, and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.
</P>
<P>3. If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:
</P>
<P>a. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or occupancy, or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware;
</P>
<P>b. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and
</P>
<P>c. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.
</P>
<P>4. All terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.
</P>
<P>5. The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building.
</P>
<P>6. If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will continue in effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 30 days after we notify the mortgagee of the cancellation or non-renewal.
</P>
<P>7. If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you, we are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's claim.
</P>
<HD2>O. Suit Against Us
</HD2>
<P>You may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you have complied with all the requirements of the policy. If you do sue, you must start the suit within one year of the date of the written denial of all or part of the claim, and you must file the suit in the United States District Court of the district in which the insured property was located at the time of loss. This requirement applies to any claim that you may have under this policy and to any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.
</P>
<HD2>P. Subrogation
</HD2>
<P>Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this policy, we are subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person. That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you may keep any of that money.
</P>
<HD2>Q. Continuous Lake Flood
</HD2>
<P>1. If an insured building has been flooded by rising lake waters continuously for 90 days or more and it appears reasonably certain that a continuation of this flooding will result in an insured loss to the insured building equal to or greater than the building policy limits plus the deductible or the maximum payable under the policy for any one building loss, we will pay you the lesser of these two amounts without waiting for the further damage to occur if you sign a release agreeing:
</P>
<P>a. To make no further claim under this policy;
</P>
<P>b. Not to seek renewal of this policy;
</P>
<P>c. Not to apply for any flood insurance under the Act for property at the described location;
</P>
<P>d. Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior terms.
</P>
<P>If the policy term ends before the insured building has been flooded continuously for 90 days, the provisions of this paragraph Q.1 will apply when the insured building suffers a covered loss before the policy term ends.
</P>
<P>2. If your insured building is subject to continuous lake flooding from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file a claim under either paragraph Q.1 above or Q.2 (A “closed basin lake” is a natural lake from which water leaves primarily through evaporation and whose surface area now exceeds or has exceeded one square mile at any time in the recorded past. Most of the nation's closed basin lakes are in the western half of the United States where annual evaporation exceeds annual precipitation and where lake levels and surface areas are subject to considerable fluctuation due to wide variations in the climate. These lakes may overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under this paragraph Q.2, we will pay your claim as if the building is a total loss even though it has not been continuously inundated for 90 days, subject to the following conditions:
</P>
<P>a. Lake floodwaters must damage or imminently threaten to damage your building.
</P>
<P>b. Before approval of your claim, you must:
</P>
<P>(1) Agree to a claim payment that reflects your buying back the salvage on a negotiated basis; and
</P>
<P>(2) Grant the conservation easement described in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes” to be recorded in the office of the local recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with the community in which the property is located, will identify on a map an area or areas of special consideration (ASC) in which there is a potential for flood damage from continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the community the agreed-upon map showing the ASC. This easement will only apply to that portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow certain agricultural and recreational uses of the land. The only structures it will allow on any portion of the property within the ASC are certain simple agricultural and recreational structures. If any of these allowable structures are insurable buildings under the NFIP and are insured under the NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits of this paragraph Q.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers certified flood control project or otherwise certified flood control project later protects the property, FEMA will, upon request, amend the ASC to remove areas protected by those projects. The restrictions of the easement will then no longer apply to any portion of the property removed from the ASC; and
</P>
<P>(3) Comply with paragraphs Q.1.a through Q.1.d above.
</P>
<P>c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must move your building to a new location outside the ASC. FEMA will give you an additional 30 days to move if you show there is sufficient reason to extend the time.
</P>
<P>d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must acquire an elevation certificate and a floodplain development permit from the local floodplain administrator for the new location of your building.
</P>
<P>e. Before the approval of your claim, the community having jurisdiction over your building must:
</P>
<P>(1) Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a temporary moratorium for a period not to exceed 6 months to be followed immediately by a permanent land use ordinance that is consistent with the provisions specified in the easement required in paragraph Q.2.b above;
</P>
<P>(2) Agree to declare and report any violations of this ordinance to FEMA so that under Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, flood insurance to the building can be denied; and
</P>
<P>(3) Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for purposes compatible with open space or agricultural or recreational use only, any affected property the community acquires an interest in. These deed restrictions must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q.2.b above, except that, even if a certified project protects the property, the land use restrictions continue to apply if the property was acquired under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. If a non-profit land trust organization receives the property as a donation, that organization must maintain the property as deed-restricted, consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q2.b. above.
</P>
<P>f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected State must take all action set forth in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes.”
</P>
<P>g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage continuously in effect from a date established by FEMA until you file a claim under paragraph Q.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance that goes into effect within 60 days of the date of transfer of title, any gap in coverage during that 60-day period will not be a violation of this continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose of honoring a claim under this paragraph Q.2, we will not consider to be in effect any increased coverage that became effective after the date established by FEMA. The exception to this is any increased coverage in the amount suggested by your insurer as an inflation adjustment.
</P>
<P>h. This paragraph Q.2 will be in effect for a community when the FEMA Regional Administrator for the affected region provides to the community, in writing, the following:
</P>
<P>(1) Confirmation that the community and the State are in compliance with the conditions in paragraphs Q.2.e and Q.2.f above; and
</P>
<P>(2) The date by which you must have flood insurance in effect.
</P>
<HD2>R. Loss Settlement
</HD2>
<P>We will pay the least of the following amounts after application of the deductible:
</P>
<P>1. The applicable amount of insurance under this policy;
</P>
<P>2. The actual cash value; or
</P>
<P>3. The amount it would cost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality within a reasonable time after the loss.
</P>
<HD1>VIII. Policy Nullification, Cancellation, and Non-Renewal
</HD1>
<HD2>A. Policy Nullification for Fraud, Misrepresentation, or Making False Statements
</HD2>
<P>1. With respect to all insureds under this policy, this policy is void and has no legal force and effect if at any time, before or after a loss, you or any other insured or your agent have, with respect to this policy or any other NFIP insurance:
</P>
<P>a. Concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance;
</P>
<P>b. Engaged in fraudulent conduct; or
</P>
<P>c. Made false statements.
</P>
<P>2. Policies voided under A.1 cannot be renewed or replaced by a new NFIP policy.
</P>
<P>3. Policies are void as of the date the acts described in A.1 above were committed.
</P>
<P>4. Fines, civil penalties, and imprisonment under applicable Federal laws may also apply to the acts of fraud or concealment described above.
</P>
<HD2>B. Policy Nullification for Reasons Other Than Fraud
</HD2>
<P>1. This policy is void from its inception, and has no legal force or effect, if:
</P>
<P>a. The property listed on the application is located in a community that was not participating in the NFIP on this policy's inception date and did not join or reenter the program during the policy term and before the loss occurred;
</P>

</HD3>
<P>Please read the policy carefully. The flood insurance provided is subject to limitations, restrictions, and exclusions.
</P>
<HD1>I. Agreement
</HD1>
<P>A. This policy insures only a residential condominium building in a regular program community. If the community reverts to emergency program status during the policy term and remains as an emergency program community at time of renewal, this policy cannot be renewed.
</P>
<P>B. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides flood insurance under the terms of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and its amendments, and Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
</P>
<P>C. We will pay you for direct physical loss by or from flood to your insured property if you:
</P>
<P>1. Have paid the full amount due (including applicable premiums, surcharges, and fees);
</P>
<P>2. Comply with all terms and conditions of this policy; and
</P>
<P>3. Have furnished accurate information and statements.
</P>
<P>D. We have the right to review the information you give us at any time and revise your policy based on our review.
</P>
<P>E. This policy insures only one building. If you own more than one building, coverage will apply to the single building specifically described in the Flood Insurance Application.
</P>
<P>F. Subject to the exception in Section I.G below, multiple policies with building coverage cannot be issued to insure a single building to one insured or to different insureds, even if issued through different NFIP insurers. Payment for damages may only be made under a single policy for building damages under Coverage A—Building Property.
</P>
<P>G. A Dwelling Form policy with building coverage may be issued to a unit owner in a condominium building that is also insured under a Residential Condominium Building Association Policy (RCBAP). However, no more than $250,000 may be paid in combined benefits for a single unit under the Dwelling Form and the RCBAP. We will only pay for damage once. Items of damage paid for under a RCBAP cannot also be claimed under the Dwelling Form policy.

<P>(1) Be a “repetitive loss building.” A repetitive loss building is one that meets the following conditions:
</P>
<P>(a) The building is insured by a contract of flood insurance issued under the NFIP.
</P>
<P>(b) The building has suffered flood damage on two occasions during a 10-year period which ends on the date of the second loss.
</P>
<P>(c) The cost to repair the flood damage, on average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each flood loss.
</P>
<P>(d) In addition to the current claim, the NFIP must have paid the previous qualifying claim, and the State or community must have a cumulative, substantial damage provision or repetitive loss provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building; or
</P>
<P>(2) Be a building that has had flood damage in which the cost to repair equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building at the time of the flood. The State or community must have a substantial damage provision in its floodplain management law or ordinance being enforced against the building.
</P>
<P>b. This Coverage D pays you to comply with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances that meet the minimum standards of the National Flood Insurance Program found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 60.3. We pay for compliance activities that exceed those standards under these conditions:
</P>
<P>(1) 3.a.1 above.
</P>
<P>(2) Elevation or floodproofing in any risk zone to preliminary or advisory base flood elevations provided by FEMA which the State or local government has adopted and is enforcing for flood-damaged buildings in such areas. (This includes compliance activities in B, C, X, or D zones which are being changed to zones with base flood elevations. This also includes compliance activities in zones where base flood elevations are being increased, and a flood-damaged building must comply with the higher advisory base flood elevation.) Increased Cost of Compliance coverage does not apply to situations in B, C, X, or D zones where the community has derived its own elevations and is enforcing elevation or floodproofing requirements for flood-damaged buildings to elevations derived solely by the community.
</P>
<P>(3) Elevation or floodproofing above the base flood elevation to meet State or local “freeboard” requirements, <I>i.e.,</I> that a building must be elevated above the base flood elevation.
</P>
<P>c. Under the minimum NFIP criteria at 44 CFR 60.3(b)(4), States and communities must require the elevation or floodproofing of buildings in unnumbered A zones to the base flood elevation where elevation data is obtained from a Federal, State, or other source. Such compliance activities are also eligible for Coverage D.
</P>
<P>d. Coverage D will pay for the incremental cost, after demolition or relocation, of elevating or floodproofing a building during its rebuilding at the same or another site to meet State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances, subject to Exclusion D.5.g below relating to improvements.
</P>
<P>e. Coverage D will pay to bring a flood-damaged building into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances even if the building had received a variance before the present loss from the applicable floodplain management requirements.
</P>
<HD3>4. Conditions
</HD3>
<P>a. When a building insured under Coverage A—Building Property sustains a loss caused by a flood, our payment for the loss under this Coverage D will be for the increased cost to elevate, floodproof, relocate, or demolish (or any combination of these activities) caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Our payment for eligible demolition activities will be for the cost to demolish and clear the site of the building debris or a portion thereof caused by the enforcement of current State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws. Eligible activities for the cost of clearing the site will include those necessary to discontinue utility service to the site and ensure proper abandonment of on-site utilities.
</P>
<P>b. When the building is repaired or rebuilt, it must be intended for the same occupancy as the present building unless otherwise required by current floodplain management ordinances or laws.
</P>
<HD3>5. Exclusions
</HD3>
<P>Under this Coverage D (Increased Cost of Compliance) we will not pay for:
</P>
<P>a. The cost to comply with any floodplain management law or ordinance in communities participating in the Emergency Program.
</P>
<P>b. The cost associated with enforcement of any ordinance or law that requires any insured or others to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way respond to, or assess the effects of pollutants.
</P>
<P>c. The loss in value to any insured building due to the requirements of any ordinance or law.
</P>
<P>d. The loss in residual value of the undamaged portion of a building demolished as a consequence of enforcement of any State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.
</P>
<P>e. Any Increased Cost of Compliance under this Coverage D:
</P>
<P>(1) Until the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated on the same or to another premises; and
</P>
<P>(2) Unless the building is elevated, floodproofed, demolished, or relocated as soon as reasonably possible after the loss, not to exceed two years.
</P>
<P>f. Any code upgrade requirements, <I>e.g.,</I> plumbing or electrical wiring, not specifically related to the State or local floodplain management law or ordinance.
</P>
<P>g. Any compliance activities needed to bring additions or improvements made after the loss occurred into compliance with State or local floodplain management laws or ordinances.
</P>
<P>h. Loss due to any ordinance or law that you were required to comply with before the current loss.
</P>
<P>i. Any rebuilding activity to standards that do not meet the NFIP's minimum requirements. This includes any situation where the insured has received from the State or community a variance in connection with the current flood loss to rebuild the property to an elevation below the base flood elevation.
</P>
<P>j. Increased Cost of Compliance for a garage or carport.
</P>
<P>k. Any building insured under an NFIP Group Flood Insurance Policy.
</P>
<P>l. Assessments made by a condominium association on individual condominium unit owners to pay increased costs of repairing commonly owned buildings after a flood in compliance with State or local floodplain management ordinances or laws.
</P>
<HD3>6. Other Provisions
</HD3>
<P>a. Increased Cost of Compliance coverage will not be included in the calculation to determine whether coverage meets the coinsurance requirement for replacement cost coverage under Art. VIII.R. (“Loss Settlement”).
</P>
<P>b. All other conditions and provisions of this policy apply.
</P>
<HD1>IV. Property Not Insured
</HD1>
<P>We do not insure any of the following:
</P>
<P>1. Personal property not inside a building.

</P>
<P>11. Buildings and all their contents if more than 49 percent of the actual cash value of the building is below ground, unless the lowest level is at or above the base flood elevation and is below ground by reason of earth having been used as insulation material in conjunction with energy efficient building techniques.

</P>
<P>16. Personal property used in connection with any incidental commercial occupancy or use of the building.
</P>
<HD1>V. Exclusions
</HD1>
<P>A. We only pay for “direct physical loss by or from flood,” which means that we do not pay you for:
</P>
<P>1. Loss of revenue or profits;
</P>
<P>2. Loss of access to the insured property or described location;
</P>
<P>3. Loss of use of the insured property or described location;

</P>
<P>6. The cost of complying with any ordinance or law requiring or regulating the construction, demolition, remodeling, renovation, or repair of property, including removal of any resulting debris. This exclusion does not apply to any eligible activities we describe in Coverage D—Increased Cost of Compliance; or
</P>
<P>7. Any other economic loss you suffer.
</P>
<P>B. <I>Flood in Progress.</I> If this policy became effective as of the time of a loan closing, as provided by 44 CFR 61.11(b), we will not pay for a loss caused by a flood that is a continuation of a flood that existed prior to coverage becoming effective. In all other circumstances, we will not pay for a loss caused by a flood that is a continuation of a flood that existed on or before the day you submitted the application for coverage under this policy and the correct premium. We will determine the date of application using 44 CFR 611.11(f).
</P>
<P>C. We do not insure for loss to property caused directly by earth movement even if the earth movement is caused by flood. Some examples of earth movement that we do not cover are:
</P>
<P>1. Earthquake;
</P>
<P>2. Landslide;
</P>
<P>3. Land subsidence;
</P>
<P>4. Sinkholes;
</P>
<P>5. Destabilization or movement of land that results from accumulation of water in subsurface land areas; or
</P>
<P>6. Gradual erosion.
</P>
<P>We do, however, pay for losses from mudflow and land subsidence as a result of erosion that are specifically covered under our definition of flood (<I>see</I> II.B.1.c and II.B.2).
</P>
<P>D. We do not insure for direct physical loss caused directly or indirectly by:
</P>
<P>1. The pressure or weight of ice;
</P>
<P>2. Freezing or thawing;
</P>
<P>3. Rain, snow, sleet, hail, or water spray;
</P>
<P>4. Water, moisture, mildew, or mold damage that results primarily from any condition:
</P>
<P>a. Substantially confined to the insured building; or
</P>
<P>b. That is within your control including, but not limited to:
</P>
<P>(1) Design, structural, or mechanical defects;
</P>
<P>(2) Failures, stoppages, or breakage of water or sewer lines, drains, pumps, fixtures, or equipment; or
</P>
<P>(3) Failure to inspect and maintain the property after a flood recedes;
</P>
<P>5. Water or water-borne material that:
</P>
<P>a. Backs up through sewers or drains;
</P>
<P>b. Discharges or overflows from a sump, sump pump, or related equipment; or
</P>
<P>c. Seeps or leaks on or through the insured property; unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the sewer or drain backup, sump pump discharge or overflow, or the seepage of water;
</P>
<P>6. The pressure or weight of water unless there is a flood in the area and the flood is the proximate cause of the damage from the pressure or weight of water;
</P>
<P>7. Power, heating, or cooling failure unless the failure results from direct physical loss by or from flood to power, heating, or cooling equipment on the described location;
</P>
<P>8. Theft, fire, explosion, wind, or windstorm;
</P>
<P>9. Anything you or your agents do or conspire to do to cause loss by flood deliberately; or
</P>
<P>10. Alteration of the insured property that significantly increases the risk of flooding.
</P>
<P>E. We do not insure for loss to any building or personal property located on land leased from the Federal Government, arising from or incident to the flooding of the land by the Federal Government, where the lease expressly holds the Federal Government harmless under flood insurance issued under any Federal Government program.
</P>
<P>F. We do not pay for the testing for or monitoring of pollutants unless required by law or ordinance.
</P>
<HD1>VI. Deductibles
</HD1>
<P>A. When a loss is insured under this policy, we will pay only that part of the loss that exceeds your deductible amount, subject to the limit of liability that applies. The deductible amount is shown on the Declarations Page.
</P>
<P>However, when a building under construction, alteration, or repair does not have at least two rigid exterior walls and a fully secured roof at the time of loss, your deductible amount will be two times the deductible that would otherwise apply to a completed building.
</P>
<P>B. In each loss from flood, separate deductibles apply to the building and personal property insured by this policy.
</P>
<P>C. No deductible applies to:
</P>
<P>1. III.C.2. Loss Avoidance Measures; or
</P>
<P>2. III.D. Increased Cost of Compliance.
</P>
<HD1>VII. Coinsurance
</HD1>
<P>A. This Coinsurance Section applies only to coverage on the building.
</P>
<P>B. We will impose a penalty on loss payment unless the amount of insurance applicable to the damaged building is:
</P>
<P>1. At least 80 percent of its replacement cost; or
</P>
<P>2. The maximum amount of insurance available for that building under the NFIP, whichever is less.
</P>
<P>C. If the actual amount of insurance on the building is less than the required amount in accordance with the terms of VII.B above, then loss payment is determined as follows (subject to all other relevant conditions in this policy, including those pertaining to valuation, adjustment, settlement, and payment of loss):
</P>
<P>1. Divide the actual amount of insurance carried on the building by the required amount of insurance.
</P>
<P>2. Multiply the amount of loss, before application of the deductible, by the figure determined in C.1 above.
</P>
<P>3. Subtract the deductible from the figure determined in C.2 above.
</P>
<P>We will pay the amount determined in C.3 above, or the amount of insurance carried, whichever is less. The amount of insurance carried, if in excess of the applicable maximum amount of insurance available under the NFIP, is reduced accordingly.
</P>
<HD2>Examples
</HD2>
<FP-1>Example #1 (Inadequate Insurance)
</FP-1>
<FP-1>Replacement value of the building—$250,000
</FP-1>
<FP-1>Required amount of insurance—$200,000
</FP-1>
<FP-1>(80 percent of replacement value of $250,000)
</FP-1>
<FP-1>Actual amount of insurance carried—$180,000
</FP-1>
<FP-1>Amount of the loss—$150,000
</FP-1>
<FP-1>Deductible—$500
</FP-1>
<FP-1>Step 1: 180,000/200,000 = .90
</FP-1>
<FP-1>(90 percent of what should be carried.)
</FP-1>
<FP-1>Step 2: 150,000 × .90 = 135,000
</FP-1>
<FP-1>Step 3: 135,000−500 = 134,500
</FP-1>
<P>We will pay no more than $134,500. The remaining $15,500 is not covered due to the coinsurance penalty ($15,000) and application of the deductible ($500).
</P>
<FP-1>Example #2 (Adequate Insurance)
</FP-1>
<FP-1>Replacement value of the building—$500,000
</FP-1>
<FP-1>Required amount of insurance—$400,000
</FP-1>
<FP-1>(80 percent of replacement value of $500,000)
</FP-1>
<FP-1>Actual amount of insurance carried—$400,000
</FP-1>
<FP-1>Amount of the loss—$200,000
</FP-1>
<FP-1>Deductible—$500
</FP-1>
<P>In this example there is no coinsurance penalty, because the actual amount of insurance carried meets the required amount. We will pay no more than $199,500 ($200,000 amount of loss minus the $500 deductible).
</P>
<P>D. In calculating the full replacement cost of a building:
</P>
<P>1. The replacement cost value of any insured building property will be included;
</P>
<P>2. The replacement cost value of any building property not insured under this policy will not be included; and
</P>
<P>3. Only the replacement cost value of improvements installed by the condominium association will be included.
</P>
<HD1>VIII. General Conditions
</HD1>
<HD2>A. Pair and Set Clause
</HD2>
<P>In case of loss to an article that is part of a pair or set, we will have the option of paying you:
</P>
<P>1. An amount equal to the cost of replacing the lost, damaged, or destroyed article, minus its depreciation; or
</P>
<P>2. The amount that represents the fair proportion of the total value of the pair or set that the lost, damaged, or destroyed article bears to the pair or set.
</P>
<HD2>B. Other Insurance
</HD2>
<P>1. If a loss insured by this policy is also insured by other insurance that includes flood coverage not issued under the Act, we will not pay more than the amount of insurance that you are entitled to for lost, damaged, or destroyed property insured under this policy subject to the following:
</P>
<P>a. We will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss, unless VIII.B.1.b or c immediately below applies.
</P>
<P>b. If the other policy has a provision stating that it is excess insurance, this policy will be primary.
</P>
<P>c. This policy will be primary (but subject to its own deductible) up to the deductible in the other flood policy (except another policy as described in VIII.B.1.b. above). When the other deductible amount is reached, this policy will participate in the same proportion that the amount of insurance under this policy bears to the total amount of both policies, for the remainder of the loss.
</P>
<P>2. If there is a National Flood Insurance Program flood insurance policy in the name of a unit owner that covers the same loss as this policy, then this policy will be primary.
</P>
<HD2>C. Amendments, Waivers, Assignment
</HD2>
<P>This policy cannot be changed, nor can any of its provisions be waived, without the express written consent of the Federal Insurance Administrator. No action we take under the terms of this policy constitutes a waiver of any of our rights. You may assign this policy in writing when you transfer title of your property to someone else except under these conditions:
</P>
<P>1. When this policy insures only personal property; or
</P>
<P>2. When this policy insures a building under construction.
</P>
<HD2>D. Insufficient Premium or Rating Information
</HD2>
<P>1. Applicability. The following provisions apply to all instances where the premium paid on this policy is insufficient or where the rating information is insufficient, such as where an Elevation Certificate is not provided.
</P>
<P>2. Reforming the Policy with Reduced Coverage. Except as otherwise provided in VIII.D.1 and VIII.D.4, if the premium we received from you was not sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will provide only the kinds and amounts of coverage that can be purchased for the premium payment we received.
</P>
<P>a. For the purpose of determining whether your premium payment is sufficient to buy the kinds and amounts of coverage you requested, we will first deduct the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges.
</P>
<P>b. If the amount paid, after deducting the costs of all applicable fees and surcharges, is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, your payment will be refunded. Unless the policy is reformed to increase the coverage amount to the amount originally requested pursuant to VIII.E.3, this policy will be cancelled, and no claims will be paid under this policy.
</P>
<P>c. Coverage limits on the reformed policy will be based upon the amount of premium submitted per type of coverage, but will not exceed the amount originally requested.
</P>
<P>3. Discovery of Insufficient Premium or Rating Information. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, the policy will be reformed as described in VIII.D.2. You have the option of increasing the amount of coverage resulting from this reformation to the amount you requested as follows:
</P>
<P>a. Insufficient Premium. If we discover that your premium payment was not sufficient to buy the requested amount of coverage, we will send you, and any mortgagee or trustee known to us, a bill for the required additional premium for the current policy term (or that portion of the current policy term following any endorsement changing the amount of coverage). If it is discovered that the initial amount charged to you for any fees or surcharges is incorrect, the difference will be added or deducted, as applicable, to the total amount in this bill.
</P>
<P>(1) If you or the mortgagee or trustee pay the additional amount due within 30 days from the date of our bill, we will reform the policy to increase the amount of coverage to the originally requested amount, effective to the beginning of the current policy term (or subsequent date of any endorsement changing the amount of coverage).
</P>
<P>(2) If you or the mortgagee or trustee do not pay the additional amount due within 30 days of the date of our bill, any flood insurance claim will be settled based on the reduced amount of coverage.
</P>
<P>(3) As applicable, you have the option of paying all or part of the amount due out of a claim payment based on the originally requested amount of coverage.
</P>
<P>b. Insufficient Rating Information. If we determine that the rating information we have is insufficient and prevents us from calculating the additional premium, we will ask you to send the required information. You must submit the information within 60 days of our request.
</P>
<P>(1) If we receive the information within 60 days of our request, we will determine the amount of additional premium for the current policy term and follow the procedure in VIII.D.3.a above.
</P>
<P>(2) If we do not receive the information within 60 days of our request, no claims will be paid until the requested information is provided. Coverage will be limited to the amount of coverage that can be purchased for the payments we received, as determined when the requested information is provided.
</P>
<P>4. Coverage Increases. If we do not receive the amount requested in VIII.D.3.a or VIII.D.4.a, or the additional information requested in VIII.D.3.b or VIII.D.4.b by the date it is due, the amount of coverage under this policy can only be increased by endorsement subject to the appropriate waiting period. However, no coverage increases will be allowed until you have provided the information requested in VIII.D.3.b or VIII.D.4.b.
</P>
<P>5. Falsifying Information. However, if we find that you or your agent intentionally did not tell us, or falsified, any important fact or circumstance or did anything fraudulent relating to this insurance, the provisions of IX.A apply.
</P>
<HD2>E. Policy Renewal
</HD2>
<P>1. This policy will expire at 12:01 a.m. on the last day of the policy term.
</P>
<P>2. We must receive the payment of the appropriate renewal premium within 30 days of the expiration date.
</P>
<P>3. If we find, however, that we did not place your renewal notice into the U.S. Postal Service, or if we did mail it, we made a mistake, <I>e.g.,</I> we used an incorrect, incomplete, or illegible address, which delayed its delivery to you before the due date for the renewal premium, then we will follow these procedures:
</P>
<P>a. If you or your agent notified us, not later than one year after the date on which the payment of the renewal premium was due, of non-receipt of a renewal notice before the due date for the renewal premium, and we determine that the circumstances in the preceding paragraph apply, we will mail a second bill providing a revised due date, which will be 30 days after the date on which the bill is mailed.
</P>
<P>b. If we do not receive the premium requested in the second bill by the revised due date, then we will not renew the policy. In that case, the policy will remain as an expired policy as of the expiration date shown on the Declarations Page.
</P>
<P>c. In connection with the renewal of this policy, we may ask you during the policy term to recertify, on a Recertification Questionnaire that we will provide you, the rating information used to rate your most recent application for or renewal of insurance.
</P>
<HD2>F. Conditions Suspending or Restricting Insurance
</HD2>
<P>We are not liable for loss that occurs while there is a hazard that is increased by any means within your control or knowledge.
</P>
<HD2>G. Requirements in Case of Loss
</HD2>
<P>In case of a flood loss to insured property, you must:
</P>
<P>1. Give prompt written notice to us.
</P>
<P>2. As soon as reasonably possible, separate the damaged and undamaged property, putting it in the best possible order so that we may examine it.
</P>
<P>3. Prepare an inventory of damaged property showing the quantity, description, actual cash value, and amount of loss. Attach all bills, receipts, and related documents.
</P>
<P>4. Within 60 days after the loss, send us a proof of loss, which is your statement of the amount you are claiming under the policy signed and sworn to by you, and which furnishes us with the following information:
</P>
<P>a. The date and time of loss;
</P>
<P>b. A brief explanation of how the loss happened;
</P>
<P>c. Your interest (for example, “owner”) and the interest, if any, of others in the damaged property;
</P>
<P>d. Details of any other insurance that may cover the loss;
</P>
<P>e. Changes in title or occupancy of the insured property during the term of the policy;
</P>
<P>f. Specifications of damaged buildings and detailed repair estimates;
</P>
<P>g. Names of mortgagees or anyone else having a lien, charge, or claim against the insured property;
</P>
<P>h. Details about who occupied any insured building at the time of loss and for what purpose; and
</P>
<P>i. The inventory of damaged personal property described in G.3 above.
</P>
<P>5. In completing the proof of loss, you must use your own judgment concerning the amount of loss and justify that amount.
</P>
<P>6. You must cooperate with the adjuster or representative in the investigation of the claim.
</P>
<P>7. The insurance adjuster whom we hire to investigate your claim may furnish you with a proof of loss form, and she or he may help you complete it. However, this is a matter of courtesy only, and you must still send us a proof of loss within 60 days after the loss even if the adjuster does not furnish the form or help you complete it.
</P>
<P>8. We have not authorized the adjuster to approve or disapprove claims or to tell you whether we will approve your claim.
</P>
<P>9. At our option, we may accept the adjuster's report of the loss instead of your proof of loss. The adjuster's report will include information about your loss and the damages you sustained. You must sign the adjuster's report. At our option, we may require you to swear to the report.
</P>
<HD2>H. Our Options After a Loss
</HD2>
<P>Options we may, in our sole discretion, exercise after loss include the following:
</P>
<P>1. At such reasonable times and places that we may designate, you must:
</P>
<P>a. Show us or our representative the damaged property;
</P>
<P>b. Submit to examination under oath, while not in the presence of another insured, and sign the same; and
</P>
<P>c. Permit us to examine and make extracts and copies of:
</P>
<P>(1) Any policies of property insurance insuring you against loss and the deed establishing your ownership of the insured real property;
</P>
<P>(2) Condominium association documents including the Declarations of the condominium, its Articles of Association or Incorporation, Bylaws, and rules and regulations; and
</P>
<P>(3) All books of accounts, bills, invoices and other vouchers, or certified copies pertaining to the damaged property if the originals are lost.
</P>
<P>2. We may request, in writing, that you furnish us with a complete inventory of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property, including:
</P>
<P>a. Quantities and costs;
</P>
<P>b. Actual cash values or replacement cost (whichever is appropriate);
</P>
<P>c. Amounts of loss claimed;
</P>
<P>d. Any written plans and specifications for repair of the damaged property that you can reasonably make available to us; and
</P>
<P>e. Evidence that prior flood damage has been repaired.
</P>
<P>3. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive your signed, sworn proof of loss, we may:
</P>
<P>a. Repair, rebuild, or replace any part of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property with material or property of like kind and quality or its functional equivalent; and
</P>
<P>b. Take all or any part of the damaged property at the value that we agree upon or its appraised value.
</P>
<HD2>I. No Benefit to Bailee
</HD2>
<P>No person or organization, other than you, having custody of insured property will benefit from this insurance.
</P>
<HD2>J. Loss Payment
</HD2>
<P>1. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some other person or entity is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. Loss will be payable 60 days after we receive your proof of loss (or within 90 days after the insurance adjuster files the adjuster's report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss) and:
</P>
<P>a. We reach an agreement with you;
</P>
<P>b. There is an entry of a final judgment; or
</P>
<P>c. There is a filing of an appraisal award with us, as provided in VIII.M.
</P>
<P>2. If we reject your proof of loss in whole or in part you may:
</P>
<P>a. Accept our denial of your claim;
</P>
<P>b. Exercise your rights under this policy; or
</P>
<P>c. File an amended proof of loss as long as it is filed within 60 days of the date of the loss.
</P>
<HD2>K. Abandonment
</HD2>
<P>You may not abandon damaged or undamaged insured property to us.
</P>
<HD2>L. Salvage
</HD2>
<P>We may permit you to keep damaged insured property after a loss, and we will reduce the amount of the loss proceeds payable to you under the policy by the value of the salvage.
</P>
<HD2>M. Appraisal
</HD2>
<P>If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value or, if applicable, replacement cost of the damaged property so as to determine the amount of loss, then either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the insured property is located. The appraisers will separately state the actual cash value, the replacement cost, and the amount of loss to each item. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of actual cash value and loss, or if it applies, the replacement cost and loss.
</P>
<P>Each party will:
</P>
<P>1. Pay its own appraiser; and
</P>
<P>2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.
</P>
<HD2>N. Mortgage Clause
</HD2>
<P>1. The word “mortgagee” includes trustee.
</P>
<P>2. Any loss payable under Coverage A—Building Property will be paid to any mortgagee of whom we have actual notice, as well as any other mortgagee or loss payee determined to exist at the time of loss, and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.
</P>
<P>3. If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:
</P>
<P>a. Notifies us of any change in the ownership or occupancy, or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware;
</P>
<P>b. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and
</P>
<P>c. Submits a signed, sworn proof of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.
</P>
<P>4. All terms of this policy apply to the mortgagee.
</P>
<P>5. The mortgagee has the right to receive loss payment even if the mortgagee has started foreclosure or similar action on the building.
</P>
<P>6. If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, it will continue in effect for the benefit of the mortgagee only for 30 days after we notify the mortgagee of the cancellation or non-renewal.
</P>
<P>7. If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you, we are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's claim.
</P>
<HD2>O. Suit Against Us
</HD2>
<P>You may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you have complied with all the requirements of the policy. If you do sue, you must start the suit within one year of the date of the written denial of all or part of the claim, and you must file the suit in the United States District Court of the district in which the insured property was located at the time of loss. This requirement applies to any claim that you may have under this policy and to any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the policy.
</P>
<HD2>P. Subrogation
</HD2>
<P>Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this policy, we are subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person. That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you may keep any of that money.
</P>
<HD2>Q. Continuous Lake Flood
</HD2>
<P>1. If an insured building has been flooded by rising lake waters continuously for 90 days or more and it appears reasonably certain that a continuation of this flooding will result in an insured loss to the insured building equal to or greater than the building policy limits plus the deductible or the maximum payable under the policy for any one building loss, we will pay you the lesser of these two amounts without waiting for the further damage to occur if you sign a release agreeing:
</P>
<P>a. To make no further claim under this policy;
</P>
<P>b. Not to seek renewal of this policy;
</P>
<P>c. Not to apply for any flood insurance under the Act for property at the described location;
</P>
<P>d. Not to seek a premium refund for current or prior terms.
</P>
<P>If the policy term ends before the insured building has been flooded continuously for 90 days, the provisions of this paragraph Q.1 will apply when the insured building suffers a covered loss before the policy term ends.
</P>
<P>2. If your insured building is subject to continuous lake flooding from a closed basin lake, you may elect to file a claim under either paragraph Q.1 above or this paragraph Q.2 (A “closed basin lake” is a natural lake from which water leaves primarily through evaporation and whose surface area now exceeds or has exceeded one square mile at any time in the recorded past. Most of the nation's closed basin lakes are in the western half of the United States where annual evaporation exceeds annual precipitation and where lake levels and surface areas are subject to considerable fluctuation due to wide variations in the climate. These lakes may overtop their basins on rare occasions.) Under this paragraph Q.2, we will pay your claim as if the building is a total loss even though it has not been continuously inundated for 90 days, subject to the following conditions:
</P>
<P>a. Lake floodwaters must damage or imminently threaten to damage your building.
</P>
<P>b. Before approval of your claim, you must:
</P>
<P>(1) Agree to a claim payment that reflects your buying back the salvage on a negotiated basis; and
</P>
<P>(2) Grant the conservation easement contained in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes,” to be recorded in the office of the local recorder of deeds. FEMA, in consultation with the community in which the property is located, will identify on a map an area or areas of special consideration (ASC) in which there is a potential for flood damage from continuous lake flooding. FEMA will give the community the agreed-upon map showing the ASC. This easement will only apply to that portion of the property in the ASC. It will allow certain agricultural and recreational uses of the land. The only structures that it will allow on any portion of the property within the ASC are certain simple agricultural and recreational structures. If any of these allowable structures are insurable buildings under the NFIP and are insured under the NFIP, they will not be eligible for the benefits of this paragraph Q.2. If a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers certified flood control project or otherwise certified flood control project later protects the property, FEMA will, upon request, amend the ASC to remove areas protected by those projects. The restrictions of the easement will then no longer apply to any portion of the property removed from the ASC; and
</P>
<P>(3) Comply with paragraphs Q.1.a through Q.1.d above.
</P>
<P>c. Within 90 days of approval of your claim, you must move your building to a new location outside the ASC. FEMA will give you an additional 30 days to move if you show there is sufficient reason to extend the time.
</P>
<P>d. Before the final payment of your claim, you must acquire an elevation certificate and a floodplain development permit from the local floodplain administrator for the new location of your building.
</P>
<P>e. Before the approval of your claim, the community having jurisdiction over your building must:
</P>
<P>(1) Adopt a permanent land use ordinance, or a temporary moratorium for a period not to exceed 6 months to be followed immediately by a permanent land use ordinance, that is consistent with the provisions specified in the easement required in paragraph Q.2.b above;
</P>
<P>(2) Agree to declare and report any violations of this ordinance to FEMA so that under Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, flood insurance to the building can be denied; and
</P>
<P>(3) Agree to maintain as deed-restricted, for purposes compatible with open space or agricultural or recreational use only, any affected property the community acquires an interest in. These deed restrictions must be consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q.2.b above, except that even if a certified project protects the property, the land use restrictions continue to apply if the property was acquired under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program or the Flood Mitigation Assistance Program. If a non-profit land trust organization receives the property as a donation, that organization must maintain the property as deed-restricted, consistent with the provisions of paragraph Q.2.b above.
</P>
<P>f. Before the approval of your claim, the affected State must take all action set forth in FEMA's “Policy Guidance for Closed Basin Lakes.”
</P>
<P>g. You must have NFIP flood insurance coverage continuously in effect from a date established by FEMA until you file a claim under this paragraph Q.2. If a subsequent owner buys NFIP insurance that goes into effect within 60 days of the date of transfer of title, any gap in coverage during that 60-day period will not be a violation of this continuous coverage requirement. For the purpose of honoring a claim under this paragraph Q.2, we will not consider to be in effect any increased coverage that became effective after the date established by FEMA. The exception to this is any increased coverage in the amount suggested by your insurer as an inflation adjustment.
</P>
<P>h. This paragraph Q.2 will be in effect for a community when the FEMA Regional Administrator for the affected region provides to the community, in writing, the following:
</P>
<P>(1) Confirmation that the community and the State are in compliance with the conditions in paragraphs Q2.e and Q.2.f above; and
</P>
<P>(2) The date by which you must have flood insurance in effect.
</P>
<HD2>R. Loss Settlement
</HD2>
<HD3>1. Introduction
</HD3>
<P>This policy provides three methods of settling losses: Replacement Cost, Special Loss Settlement, and Actual Cash Value. Each method is used for a different type of property, as explained in a-c below.
</P>
<P>a. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement, described in R.2 below applies to buildings other than manufactured homes or travel trailers.
</P>
<P>b. Special Loss Settlement, described in R.3 below applies to a residential condominium building that is a travel trailer or a manufactured home.
</P>
<P>c. Actual Cash Value Loss Settlement applies to all other property insured under this policy, as outlined in R.4. below.
</P>
<HD3>2. Replacement Cost Loss Settlement
</HD3>
<P>a. We will pay to repair or replace a damaged or destroyed building, after application of the deductible and without deduction for depreciation, but not more than the least of the following amounts:
</P>
<P>(1) The amount of insurance in this policy that applies to the building;
</P>
<P>(2) The replacement cost of that part of the building damaged, with materials of like kind and quality, and for like occupancy and use; or
</P>
<P>(3) The necessary amount actually spent to repair or replace the damaged part of the building for like occupancy and use.
</P>
<P>b. We will not be liable for any loss on a Replacement Cost Coverage basis unless and until actual repair or replacement of the damaged building or parts thereof, is completed.
</P>
<P>c. If a building is rebuilt at a location other than the described location, we will pay no more than it would have cost to repair or rebuild at the described location, subject to all other terms of Replacement Cost Loss Settlement.
</P>
<HD3>3. Special Loss Settlement
</HD3>
<P>a. The following loss settlement conditions apply to a residential condominium building that is:
</P>
<P>(1) A manufactured home or travel trailer, as defined in II.C.6.b and c; and
</P>
<P>(2) at least 16 feet wide when fully assembled and has at least 600 square feet within its perimeter walls when fully assembled.
</P>
<P>b. If such a building is totally destroyed or damaged to such an extent that, in our judgment, it is not economically feasible to repair, at least to its pre-damaged condition, we will, at our discretion, pay the least of the following amounts:
</P>
<P>(1) The lesser of the replacement cost of the manufactured home or travel trailer or 1.5 times the actual cash value; or
</P>
<P>(2) The building limit of liability shown on your Declarations Page.
</P>
<P>c. If such a manufactured home or travel trailer is partially damaged and, in our judgment, it is economically feasible to repair it to its pre-damaged condition, we will settle the loss according to the Replacement Cost Loss Settlement conditions in R.2 above.
</P>
<HD3>4. Actual Cash Value Loss Settlement
</HD3>
<P>a. The types of property noted below are subject to actual cash value loss settlement:
</P>
<P>(1) Personal property;
</P>
<P>(2) Insured property abandoned after a loss and that remains as debris at the described location;
</P>
<P>(3) Outside antennas and aerials, awnings, and other outdoor equipment;
</P>
<P>(4) Carpeting and pads;
</P>
<P>(5) Appliances; and
</P>
<P>(6) A manufactured home or mobile home or a travel trailer as defined in II.C.6.b or c that does not meet the conditions for special loss settlement in R.3 above.
</P>
<P>b. We will pay the least of the following amounts:
</P>
<P>(1) The applicable amount of insurance under this policy;
</P>
<P>(2) The actual cash value, as defined in II.C.2; or
</P>
<P>(3) The amount it would cost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality within a reasonable time after the loss.
</P>
<HD1>IX. Policy Nullification, Cancellation, and Non-Renewal
</HD1>
<HD2>A. Policy Nullification for Fraud, Misrepresentation, or Making False Statements
</HD2>
<P>1. With respect to all insureds under this policy, this policy is void and has no legal force and effect if at any time, before or after a loss, you or any other insured or your agent have, with respect to this policy or any other NFIP insurance:
</P>
<P>a. Concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance;
</P>
<P>b. Engaged in fraudulent conduct; or
</P>
<P>c. Made false statements.
</P>
<P>2. Policies voided under A.1 cannot be renewed or replaced by a new NFIP policy.
</P>
<P>3. Policies are void as of the date the acts described in A.1.above were committed.
</P>
<P>4. Fines, civil penalties, and imprisonment under applicable Federal laws may also apply to the acts of fraud or concealment described above.
</P>
<HD2>B. Policy Nullification for Reasons Other Than Fraud
</HD2>
<P>1. This policy is void from its inception, and has no legal force or effect, if:
</P>
<P>a. The property listed on the application is located in a community that was not participating in the NFIP on this policy's inception date and did not join or reenter the program during the policy term and before the loss occurred;
</P>
<P>b. The property listed on the application is otherwise not eligible for coverage under the NFIP at the time of the initial application;
</P>
<P>c. You never had an insurable interest in the property listed on the application;
</P>
<P>d. You provided an agent with an application and payment, but the payment did not clear; or
</P>
<P>e. We receive notice from you, prior to the policy effective date, that you have determined not to take the policy and you are not subject to a requirement to obtain and maintain flood insurance pursuant to any statute, regulation, or contract.
</P>
<P>2. In such cases, you will be entitled to a full refund of all premium, fees, and surcharges received. However, if a claim was paid for a policy that is void, the claim payment must be returned to FEMA or offset from the premiums to be refunded before the refund will be processed.
</P>
<HD2>C. Cancellation of the Policy by You
</HD2>
<P>1. You may cancel this policy in accordance with the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.
</P>
<P>2. If you cancel this policy, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium, surcharges, or fees under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.
</P>
<HD2>D. Cancellation of the Policy by Us
</HD2>
<P>1. Cancellation for Underpayment of Amounts Owed on This Policy. This policy will be cancelled, pursuant to VIII.D.2, if it is determined that the premium amount you paid is not sufficient to buy any amount of coverage, and you do not pay the additional amount of premium owed to increase the coverage to the originally requested amount within the required time period.
</P>
<P>2. Cancellation Due to Lack of an Insurable Interest.
</P>
<P>a. If you no longer have an insurable interest in the insured property, we will cancel this policy. You will cease to have an insurable interest if:
</P>
<P>(1) For building coverage, the building was sold, destroyed, or removed.
</P>
<P>(2) For contents coverage, the contents were sold or transferred ownership, or the contents were completely removed from the described location.
</P>
<P>b. If your policy is cancelled for this reason, you may be entitled to a partial refund of premium under the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.
</P>
<P>3. Cancellation of Duplicate Policies.
</P>
<P>a. Except as allowed under Article I.F, your property may not be insured by more than one NFIP policy, and payment for damages to your property will only be made under one policy.
</P>
<P>b. Except as allowed under Article I.G, if the property is insured by more than one NFIP policy, we will cancel all but one of the policies. The policy, or policies, will be selected for cancellation in accordance with 44 CFR 62.5 and the applicable rules and guidance of the NFIP.
</P>
<P>c. If this policy is cancelled pursuant to IX.D.3.b, you may be entitled to a full or partial refund of premium, surcharges, or fees under the terms and conditions of this policy and the applicable rules and regulations of the NFIP.

</HD2>
<P>Your policy will not be renewed if:
</P>
<P>1. The community where your insured property is located is suspended or stops participating in the NFIP;
</P>
<P>2. Your building is otherwise ineligible for flood insurance under the Act;
</P>
<P>3. You have failed to provide the information we requested for the purpose of rating the policy within the required deadline.
</P>
<HD1>X. Liberalization Clause
</HD1>
<P>If we make a change that broadens your coverage under this edition of our policy, but does not require any additional premium, then that change will automatically apply to your insurance as of the date we implement the change, provided that this implementation date falls within 60 days before or during the policy term stated on the Declarations Page.
</P>
<HD1>XI. What Law Governs
</HD1>
<P>This policy and all disputes arising from the insurer's policy issuance, policy administration, or the handling of any claim under the policy are governed exclusively by the flood insurance regulations issued by FEMA, the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4001, <I>et seq.</I>), and Federal common law.
</P>
<P><I>In Witness Whereof,</I> we have signed this policy below and hereby enter into this Insurance Agreement.

<HEAD>§ 62.5   Nullifications, cancellations, and premium refunds.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Nullification</I>—(1) <I>Property ineligible at time of application.</I> FEMA will void a policy for a property that was not eligible for coverage at the time of the initial application from the commencement of the policy. FEMA must pay the policyholder a refund of all premium, fees, and surcharges paid from the date of commencement of the policy, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of receipt of verifiable evidence that the property was ineligible for coverage at the time of the initial application. If FEMA paid a claim for an ineligible property, the policyholder must return the claim payment to FEMA, or offset the payment from the premiums to be refunded, before FEMA will process the refund.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Property later becomes ineligible.</I> FEMA may not renew a policy for a property that was eligible for coverage at the time of the initial application, but later became ineligible for coverage. In such instances, FEMA must nullify the policy from the first renewal date after the property became ineligible. FEMA must refund all premium, fees, and surcharges paid from the first renewal date after the property became ineligible, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of receipt of verifiable evidence that the property was eligible for coverage at the time of the initial application, but later became ineligible for coverage. If FEMA paid a claim for a property after it became ineligible for coverage, the policyholder must return the claim payment to FEMA or FEMA must offset the amount of claim payment from the premiums to be refunded before FEMA may process the refund.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Nullification prior to policy effective date.</I> If FEMA nullifies a policy prior to the policy effective date, that policy will be void from the commencement of the nullified policy term. In such case, FEMA will refund all premium, fees, and surcharges paid for the current policy term only. If FEMA paid a claim for a policy that was improperly issued, the policyholder must return the claim payment to FEMA or FEMA must offset the amount of claim payment from the premiums to be refunded before the NFIP may process the refund.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Cancellation due to lack of an insurable interest.</I> If the policyholder had an insurable interest, but no longer has an insurable interest, in the insured property, FEMA must cancel the policy on the insured property. If FEMA cancels a policy for this reason, FEMA must refund the policyholder a pro rata share of the premium from the date the policyholder lost an insurable interest in the property, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of the cancellation request. FEMA must pay the policyholder a refund of all fees or surcharges for any full policy term during which the policyholder had no insurable interest in the insured property, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of the cancellation request. A policyholder ceases to have an insurable interest if:
</P>
<P>(1) For building coverage, the building was sold, destroyed, or removed.
</P>
<P>(2) For contents coverage, the contents were sold or transferred, or the contents were completely removed from the described location.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>No insurance coverage requirement.</I> A policyholder may cancel a policy if the policyholder was subject to a requirement by a lender, loss payee, or other Federal agency to obtain and maintain flood insurance pursuant to statute, regulation, or contract, but there is no longer such a requirement. The policyholder will receive a refund of a pro rata share of the premium for the current policy term only, calculated from the date of the cancellation request, but will not receive a refund of any fees or surcharges.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Establishment of a common expiration date.</I> A policyholder may purchase a new policy and cancel an existing policy in order to establish a common expiration date between flood insurance coverage and other coverage. The policyholder will receive a refund of a pro rata share of the premium calculated from the effective date of the new policy to the end date of the previous policy. The policyholder will not receive a refund of any fees or surcharges. In order to rewrite and cancel the policy, the following conditions must apply:
</P>
<P>(1) The new policy must be written with the same company for the same or higher amount of coverage. If the policy is written for a higher amount or different type of coverage, the waiting period in § 61.11 will apply.
</P>
<P>(2) The other insurance coverage for which the common expiration date is being established must be for coverage on the same building that is insured by the flood policy being cancelled and rewritten.
</P>
<P>(3) The coverage for the new policy must be effective prior to cancelling the existing policy.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Cancelation or nullification of duplicate NFIP policies</I>—(1) <I>Generally.</I> (i) Except as described in 44 CFR 62.5(e)(2), if an insured property is insured by more than one NFIP policy not in accordance with applicable regulations and the Standard Flood Insurance Policy, FEMA must nullify the policy with the later effective date. The policy with the earlier effective date will continue. The policyholder will receive a pro rata refund of all premium for the nullified policy from the effective date of the nullified policy, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of receipt of verifiable evidence that the insured property is insured by more than one NFIP policy. The policyholder will receive a refund of all fees or surcharges for any full policy term during which the policyholder was insured by more than one policy, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of receipt of verifiable evidence that the insured property is insured by more than one NFIP policy.
</P>
<P>(ii) If both polices have the same policy effective date, the policyholder may choose which policy will remain in effect, and the policyholder will receive a refund of all premium, fees, and surcharges for the cancelled policy from the effective date of the cancelled policy, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of receipt of verifiable evidence that the insured property is insured by more than one NFIP policy.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Exceptions.</I> In the following cases, the policyholder may maintain the policy with the later policy effective date while cancelling the policy with the earlier policy effective date:
</P>
<P>(i) The policy with the earlier effective date has expired for more than 30 days. In such cases, the policyholder will receive a refund of a pro rata share of the premium, calculated from the effective date of the policy with the later effective date to the end date of the policy with the earlier effective date, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of cancellation. The policyholder will also receive a refund of all fees and surcharges for any full policy terms during which the insured property is insured by both policies, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of the cancellation request.
</P>
<P>(ii) The policy with the earlier policy effective date is a Group Flood Insurance Policy. In such cases, there will be no refund of any premium, fees, or surcharges.
</P>
<P>(iii) The policy with the earlier effective date is cancelled to establish a common policy expiration date pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. In such cases, refunds will be provided in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P>(iv) The policy with the earlier effective date was force placed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4012a using the NFIP's Mortgage Portfolio Protection Program. In such cases, the policyholder will receive a refund of the pro rata share of the premium calculated from the policy effective date of the new policy to the expiration date of the cancelled policy. There will be no refund of any fees or surcharges.
</P>
<P>(v) The policy with the earlier effective date is a Dwelling Form policy with building coverage on a condominium unit that is also insured by a Residential Condominium Building Association Policy (RCBAP) that is issued at the statutory maximum coverage limit for buildings. In such cases, the policyholder will receive a refund of a pro rata share of the premium for the building coverage issued under the Dwelling Form policy, as calculated from the effective date of the RCBAP policy to the end date of the Dwelling Form policy. The policyholder will also receive a refund of all fees and surcharges for any full policy terms during which the condominium unit is insured by both a Dwelling Form policy and an RCBAP in which the coverage equals the statutory maximum coverage limits for buildings, but no more than 5 years prior to the date of the cancellation request.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Other cancellations and nullifications.</I> Except as indicated below, FEMA will not refund premiums, assessments, fees, or surcharges if FEMA cancels a policy for any of the following reasons:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Fraud.</I> FEMA will cancel a policy for fraud committed by the policyholder or the agent. FEMA may cancel a policy for misrepresentation of a material fact by the policyholder or agent. Such cancellations will take effect as of the date of the fraudulent act or material misrepresentation of fact.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Administrative cancellation.</I> FEMA may cancel and rewrite a policy to correct an administrative error, such as when the policy is written with the wrong policy effective date. In such cases, FEMA will apply any premium, assessments, fees, or surcharges to the new policy. FEMA will refund any excess premium, fees, surcharges, or assessments paid.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Nullification for properties ineligible due to physical alteration of property.</I> A policy insuring a building or its contents, or both, may be cancelled if the building has been physically altered in such a manner that the building and its contents are no longer eligible for flood insurance coverage. The policyholder will receive a refund of a pro rata share of the premium for the current policy term only, but the policyholder will not receive a refund of any fees or surcharges.

<HEAD>§ 62.20   Claims appeals.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Definitions.</I>
</P>
<P><I>Appeal decision</I> means the disposition of the appeal by the Federal Insurance Administrator.
</P>
<P><I>Decision</I> means the insurer's final claim determination, which is the insurer's written denial, in whole or in part, of the insured's claim.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Appeal.</I> A National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) policyholder, whether insured by a participating Write-Your-Own (WYO) Company or directly by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), may appeal a <I>decision</I>, including a determination of any insurance agent, adjuster, insurance company, or any FEMA employee or contractor with respect to a claim, proof of loss, and loss estimate. In order to file an appeal, the insured must comply with all requirements set out in the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP). This appeals process is available after the issuance of the insurer's final claim determination, which is the insurer's written denial, in whole or in part, of the insured's claim. Once the final claim determination is issued, an insured may appeal any action taken by the insurer, FEMA employee, FEMA contractor, insurance adjuster, or insurance agent.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Limitations on Appeals.</I> The appeals process is intended to resolve claim issues and is not intended to grant coverage or limits that are not provided by the SFIP. Filing an appeal does not waive any of the requirements for perfecting a claim under the SFIP or extend any of the time limitations set forth in the SFIP.
</P>
<P>(1) Disputes that are or have been subject to appraisal as provided for in the SFIP cannot be appealed under this section.
</P>
<P>(2) When a policyholder files an appeal on any issue, that issue is no longer subject to resolution by appraisal or other pre-litigation remedies.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Litigation preclusion.</I> An insured who files suit against an insurer on the flood insurance claim issue is prohibited from filing an appeal under this section. All appeals submitted for decision but not yet resolved shall be terminated upon notice of the commencement of litigation regarding the claim.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Procedures.</I> To pursue an appeal under this section a policyholder must:
</P>
<P>(1) Submit a written appeal to FEMA within 60 days from the date of the decision.
</P>
<P>(2) Provide a copy of the insurer's written denial, in whole or in part, of the claim;
</P>
<P>(3) Identify relevant policy and claim information and state the basis for the appeal; and
</P>
<P>(4) Submit relevant documentation to support the appeal. The policyholder should submit only the documentation that pertains to his or her claim. The following are examples of the kinds of documentation which FEMA will require to adjudicate the appeal: A copy of the proof of loss submitted to the insurer as required in the policy; room by room itemized estimates from the adjuster (includes contractors' estimates), detailing unit cost and quantities for the items needing repair or replacement; replacement cost proofs of loss; Preliminary Report; Final Report; detailed damaged personal property inventories that include the approximate age of the items; completed Mobile Home Worksheet; Mobile Home Title, including Salvage Titles; real estate appraisals that exclude land values; advance payment information; clear photographs (exterior and interior) confirming damage resulted from direct physical loss by or from flood; proof of prior repair; evidence of insurance and policy information , <I>i.e.</I> declarations page; Elevation Certificate, if the risk is an elevated building; the community's determination made concerning substantial damage; information regarding substantial improvement; zone determinations; pre-loss and post-loss inventories; financial statements; tax records, lease agreements, sales contracts, settlement papers, deed, <I>etc.</I>; emergency (911) address change information; salvage information (proceeds and sales); condominium association by-laws; proof of other insurance, including homeowners or wind policies and any claim information submitted to the other companies; Waiver, Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) or Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) information; paid receipts and invoices including cancelled checks that support an insured's out-of-pocket expenses pertaining to the claim; underwriting decisions; architectural plans and drawings; death certificates; a copy of the will; divorce decree, power of attorney; current lienholder information; current loss payee information; paid receipts and invoices documenting damaged stock; detailed engineering reports specifically addressing flood-related damage and pre-existing damage; engineering surveys; market values; documentation of Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) dates; documentation reflecting date(s) of construction and substantial improvement; loan documents including closings; evidence of insurability as a Residential Condominium Association; Franchise Agreements; letters of representation, <I>i.e.</I> attorneys and public adjusters; any assignment of interest in a claim; and, any other pertinent information which FEMA may request in processing a claim.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Appeal resolution.</I> (1) FEMA will acknowledge, in writing, receipt of a policyholder's appeal and include in the acknowledgement contact information for a FEMA point of contact who can advise the policyholder as to the status of his or her claim. 
</P>
<P>(2) The <I>Federal Insurance Administrator</I> will review the appeal documents and may notify the policyholder in writing of the need for additional information. A request for the additional information will include the date by which the information must be provided, and shall in no case be less than 14 calendar days. Failure to provide the requested information in full, or to request an extension by the due date, may result in a dismissal of the appeal. A re-inspection of the policyholder's property may be conducted at the discretion of the <I>Federal Insurance Administrator</I> to gather more information. The <I>Federal Insurance Administrator</I> will ensure that all information necessary to rule on the appeal has been provided prior to making an <I>appeal decision.</I>
</P>
<P>(3) The <I>Federal Insurance Administrator</I> will review the appeal documents, including any reinspection report, if appropriate. The Federal Insurance Administrator will provide specific information on what grounds the claim was denied initially. The Federal Insurance Administrator will provide an <I>appeal decision</I> in writing to the policyholder and insurer within 90 days from the date that all information has been submitted by the policyholder and include specific information for the resolution of the appeal. No further administrative review will be provided to the insured.
</P>
<P>(4) A policyholder who does not agree with FEMA's appeal decision should refer to the SFIP, for options for further action (<I>see</I> Part 61, App. A(1) VII.R., Part 61, App. A(2) VII.R., and Part 61, App. A(3) VIII.R.). The one-year period to file suit commences with the written denial from the insurer and is not extended by the appeals process.

<DIV8 N="§ 62.23" NODE="44:1.0.1.2.27.3.9.1" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 62.23   WYO Companies authorized.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Pursuant to section 1345 of the Act, the Federal Insurance Administrator may enter into arrangements with individual private sector property insurance companies or other insurers, such as public entity risk sharing organizations. Under these arrangements, such companies or other insurers may offer flood insurance coverage under the program to eligible applicants. Such WYO companies may offer flood coverage to policyholders insured by them under their own property business lines of insurance, pursuant to their customary business practices, including their usual arrangements with agents and producers. WYO companies may sell flood insurance coverage in any State in which the WYO company is authorized to engage in the business of property insurance. Other WYO insurers may offer flood insurance coverage to their pool members insured by them under their own property business lines of coverage, pursuant to their customary business practices. These other WYO insurers may provide flood coverage in any State that has authorized the other insurer to provide property coverage to its members. Arrangements entered into by WYO companies or other insurers under this subpart must be in the form and substance of the standard arrangement, titled “Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement.” Each year, at least six months before the effective date of the “Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement,” FEMA must publish in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and make available to the WYO companies the terms for subscription or re-subscription to the “Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement.” 
</P>
<P>(b) Any duly authorized insurer so engaged in the Program shall be a WYO Company. (The term “WYO Company” shall include the following kinds of insurers: Public entity risk-sharing organizations, an association of local governments, a State association of political subdivisions, a State-sponsored municipal league, and other intergovernmental risk-sharing pool for covering public entity structures.) 
</P>
<P>(c) A WYO Company is authorized to arrange for the issuance of flood insurance in any amount within the maximum limits of coverage specified in § 61.6 of this subchapter, as Insurer, to any person qualifying for such coverage under parts 61 and 64 of this subchapter who submits an application to the WYO Company; coverage shall be issued under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.
</P>
<P>(d) A WYO Company issuing flood insurance coverage shall arrange for the adjustment, settlement, payment and defense of all claims arising from policies of flood insurance it issues under the Program, based upon the terms and conditions of the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.
</P>
<P>(e) In carrying out its functions under this subpart, a WYO Company shall use its own customary standards, staff and independent contractor resources, as it would in the ordinary and necessary conduct of its own business affairs, subject to the Act and regulations prescribed by the Federal Insurance Administrator under the Act.
</P>
<P>(f) To facilitate the marketing of flood insurance coverage under the Program to policyholders of WYO Companies, the Federal Insurance Administrator will enter into arrangements with such companies whereby the Federal Government will be a guarantor in which the primary relationship between the WYO Company and the Federal Government will be one of a fiduciary nature, i.e., to assure that any taxpayer funds are accounted for and appropriately expended. In furtherance of this end, the Federal Insurance Administrator has established “A Plan to Maintain Financial Control for Business Written Under the Write Your Own Program.”
</P>
<P>(g) A WYO Company shall act as a fiscal agent of the Federal Government, but not as its general agent. WYO Companies are solely responsible for their obligations to their insured under any flood insurance policies issued under agreements entered into with the Federal Insurance Administrator, such that the Federal Government is not a proper party defendant in any lawsuit arising out of such policies.
</P>
<P>(h) To facilitate the underwriting of flood insurance coverage by WYO Companies, the following procedures will be used by WYO Companies:
</P>
<P>(1) To expedite business growth, the WYO Company will encourage its present property insurance policyholders to purchase flood insurance through the NFIP WYO Program.
</P>
<P>(2) To conform its underwriting practices to the underwriting rules and rates in effect as to the NFIP, the WYO Company will establish procedures to carry out the NFIP rating system and provide its policyholders with the same coverage as is afforded under the NFIP.
</P>
<P>(3) The WYO Company may follow its customary billing practices to meet the Federal rules on the presentment of premium and net premium deposits to a Letter of Credit bank account authorized by the Federal Insurance Administrator and reduction of coverage when an underpayment is discovered.
</P>
<P>(4) The WYO Company is expected to meet the recording and reporting requirements of the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan. Transactions reported by the WYO Company under the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan will be analyzed by the NFIP Bureau &amp; Statistical Agent. A monthly report will be submitted to the WYO Company and the FIA. The analysis will cover the timeliness of WYO Company submissions, the disposition of transactions that have not passed systems edits and the reconciliation of the totals generated from transaction reports with those submitted on the WYO Company's reconciliation reports.
</P>
<P>(5) If a WYO Company rejects an application from an agent or a producer, the agent or producer shall be notified so that the business can be placed through the NFIP Servicing Agent, or another WYO Company.
</P>
<P>(6) Flood insurance coverage will be issued by the WYO Company on a separate policy form and will not be added, by endorsement, to the Company's other property insurance forms.
</P>
<P>(7) Premium payment plans must be offered by the WYO Company under the terms prescribed by the Administrator in § 61.10(a)(1).
</P>
<P>(8) NFIP business will not be assumed by the WYO Companies at any time other than at renewal time, at which time the insurance producer may submit the business to the WYO Company as new business. However, it is permissible to cancel and rewrite flood policies to obtain concurrent expiration dates with other policies covering the property.
</P>
<P>(i) To facilitate the adjustment of flood insurance claims by WYO Companies, the following procedures will be used by WYO Companies.
</P>
<P>(1) WYO companies will adjust claims in accordance with general company standards, guided by NFIP Claims manuals. The Arrangement provides that claim adjustments shall be binding upon the FIA.
</P>
<P>(2) The WYO Company may use its staff adjusters, independent adjusters, or both. It is important that the Company's Claims Department verifies the correctness of the coverage interpretations and reasonableness of the payments recommended by the adjusters.
</P>
<P>(3) An established loss adjustment Fee Schedule is part of the Arrangement and cannot be changed during an Arrangement year. This is the expense allowance to cover costs of independent or WYO Company adjusters.
</P>
<P>(4) The normal catastrophe claims procedure currently operated by a WYO Company should be implemented in the event of a claim catastrophe situation. Flood claims will be handled along with other catastrophe claims.
</P>
<P>(5) It will be the WYO Company's responsibility to try to detect fraud (as it does in the case of property insurance) and coordinate its findings with FIA.
</P>
<P>(6) Pursuant to the Arrangement, the responsibility for defending claims will be upon the Write Your Own Company and defense costs will be part of the unallocated or allocated claim expense allowance, depending on whether a staff counsel or an outside attorney handles the defense of the matter. Claims in litigation will be reported by WYO Companies to FIA upon joinder of issue and FIA may inquire and be advised of the disposition of such litigation.
</P>
<P>(7) The claim reserving procedures of the individual WYO Company can be used.
</P>
<P>(8) Regarding the handling of subrogation, if a WYO Company prefers to forego pursuit of subrogation recovery, it may do so by referring the matter, with a complete copy of the claim file, to FIA. Subrogation initiatives may be truncated at any time before suit is commenced (after commencing an action, special arrangement must bemade). FIA, after consultation with FEMA's Office of the Chief Counsel (OCC), will forward the cause of action to OCC or to the NFIP Bureau and Statistical Agent for prosecution. Any funds received will be deposited, less expenses, in the National Flood Insurance Fund.
</P>
<P>(9) Special allocated loss adjustment expenses will include such items as: nonstaff attorney fees, engineering fees and special investigation fees over and above normal adjustment practices.
</P>
<P>(10) The customary content of claim files will include coverage verification, normal adjuster investigations, including statements where necessary, police reports, building reports and investigations, damage verification and other documentation relevant to the adjustment of claims under the NFIP's and the WYO Company's traditional claim adjustment practices and procedures. The WYO Company's claim examiners and managers will supervise the adjustment of flood insurance claims by staff and independent claims adjusters.
</P>
<P>(11) The WYO Company will extend reasonable cooperation to FEMA's Office of the Chief Counsel on matters pertaining to litigation and subrogation, under paragraph (i)(8) of this section.
</P>
<P>(j) To facilitate establishment of financial controls under the WYO Program, the WYO Company will:
</P>
<P>(1) Have a biennial audit of the flood insurance financial statements conducted by an independent Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firm at the Company's expense to ensure that the financial data reported to us accurately represents the flood insurance activities of the Company. The CPA firm must conduct its audits in accordance with the generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) and Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (commonly known as “yellow book” requirements). The Company must file with us (the Federal Insurance Administration) a report of the CPA firm's detailed biennial audit, and, after our review of the audit report, we will convey our determination to the Standards Committee.
</P>
<P>(2) Participate in a WYO Company/FIA Operation review. We will conduct a review of the WYO Company's flood insurance claims, underwriting, customer service, marketing, and litigation activities at least once every three (3) years. As part of these reviews, we will reconcile specific files with a listing of transactions submitted by the Company under the Transaction Record Reporting and Processing (TRPP) Plan (Part 5). We will file a report of the Operation Review with the Standards Committee.
</P>
<P>(3) Meet the recording and reporting requirements of the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan and the WYO Accounting Procedures Manual. Transactions reported to the National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP's) Bureau and Statistical Agent by the WYO Company under the WYO Transaction Record Reporting and Processing Plan and the WYO Accounting Procedures Manual will be analyzed by the Bureau and Statistical Agent and a monthly report will be submitted to the WYO Company and the FIA. The analysis will cover the timeliness of the WYO Company submissions, the disposition of transactions which do not pass systems edits and the reconciliation of the totals generated from transaction reports with those submitted on WYO Company reconciliation reports.
</P>
<P>(4) Cooperate with FEMA's Chief Financial Officer on Letter of Credit matters.
</P>
<P>(5) Cooperate with FIA in the implementation of a claims reinspection program.
</P>
<P>(6) Cooperate with FIA in the verification of risk rating information.
</P>
<P>(7) Cooperate with DHS's Office of the Inspector General on matters pertaining to fraud.
</P>
<P>(k) To facilitate the operation of the WYO Program and in order that a WYO Company can use its own customary standards, staff and independent contractor resources, as it would in the ordinary and necessary conduct of its own business affairs, subject to the Act, the Federal Insurance Administrator, for good cause shown, may grant exceptions to and waivers of the regulations contained in this title relative to the administration of the NFIP.
</P>
<P>(l)(1) WYO Companies may, on a voluntary basis, elect to participate in the Mortgage Portfolio Protection Program (MPPP), under which they can offer, as a last resort, flood insurance at special high rates, sufficient to recover the full cost of this program in recognition of the uncertainty as to the degree of risk a given building presents due to the limited underwriting data required, to properties in a lending institution's mortgage portfolio to achieve compliance with the flood insurance purchase requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. Flood insurance policies under the MPPP may only be issued for those properties that:
</P>
<P>(i) Are determined to be located within special flood hazard areas of communities that are participating in the NFIP, and
</P>

<HEAD>§ 63.1   Purpose of part.</HEAD>
<P>The purpose of this part is to implement section 1306(c) of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (the Act). Section 544 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-242) amended the Act by adding subsection (c) to section 1306 of the Act. Under this amendment, effective February 5, 1988, section 1306(c) of the Act provides for benefit payments under the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) for demolition or relocation of a structure insured under the Act that is located along the shore of a lake or other body of water and that is certified by an appropriate State or local land use authority to be subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels. This part establishes criteria by which States can obtain the approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator to make these certifications and sets forth the procedures and data requirements to be used by those States in making these certifications. This part also contains provisions regarding other aspects of section 1306(c) of the Act. For example, there are provisions regarding section 1306(c)(6)(B) of the Act (which provides for condemnation in lieu of certification), including clarification as to the form of condemnation issued under a State or local law that is required.

<HEAD>§ 63.2   Condemnation in lieu of certification.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The condemnation required by section 1306(c)(6)(B) of the Act in lieu of certification need not be grounded in a finding that the structure is subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of erosion, but may be issued for other reasons deemed sufficient by the State or local authority.
</P>
<P>(b) The condemnation may be in the form of a court order or other instrument authorized by State or local law, e.g., a notification to the property owner of an unsafe condition, or unsanitary condition, or other deficiency at the property address, coupled with a statement that the property owner must vacate the property if the condition giving rise to the condemnation notice is not cured by repair, removal, or demolition of the building by a date certain.
</P>
<P>(c) In addition to a condemnation in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a structure must be found by the Federal Insurance Administrator to be subject to imminent collapse or subsidence as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels to be eligible for benefits under section 1306(c) of the Act.

<P>Any State that has been determined to be eligible by the Federal Insurance Administrator may certify that a coastal structure is subject to imminent collapse. Such certification requires that the State collect scientific or technical information relative to the structure and its site and provide such information to the insured to be filed with a claim for insurance benefits under Section 1306 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended. The information which is provided to the insured shall include, but is not limited to, the following:
</P>
<P>(a) Certification from the State agency that the structure is subject to imminent collapse. The certification shall cite the property address, legal description (e.g., lot, block), the date of application for certification, and the date of and basis for the certification, and
</P>
<P>(b) Supporting scientific and technical data to substantiate the certification consisting of the following:
</P>
<P>(1) Photographs of the structure in relation to the obvious peril. All photographs should be labeled with the location, direction, date and time from which they were taken. The collection of photographs should adequately display the following:
</P>
<P>(i) Any evidence of existing damage. The damage can include loss or erosion of soil near or around the foundation, or structural damage to the foundation components.
</P>
<P>(ii) Structure and waterbody. These photographs shall show both the structure and the waterbody that presents the peril. If the structure is on a high bluff or dune and not accessible from the water side, the top edge of the bluff or dune will be sufficient. These will usually be taken from one or both sides of the structure.
</P>
<P>(iii) Physical reference features used in the measurements discussed below. The reference feature shall be in or near the area affected by normal tides, when applicable. If a reference is not clearly distinguishable on the photograph, it should be annotated to identify the feature. If possible, all reference features described below should be photographed showing their relationship to the site of the threatened structure.
</P>
<P>(2) Identification and selection of reference features. The following reference features are presented according to priority. If the first feature is not present, the next feature shall be located and photographed, and so forth.
</P>
<P>(i) Top edge of bluff (cliff top).
</P>
<P>(ii) Top edge of escarpment on an eroding dune (i.e., a nearly vertical erosional cut at the seaward face of the dune). The normal high tide should be near the toe of the dune and there should be indications that the dune is actively eroding.
</P>
<P>(iii) The normal high tide limit may be indicated by one of the following:
</P>
<P>(A) Vegetation line (the seaward most edge of permanent vegetation).
</P>
<P>(B) Beach scarp (erosion line on beach, usually a sharp, nearly vertical drop of 0.5 to 3.0 feet at the upper limit of high tide).
</P>
<P>(C) Debris line deposited by the normal high tide, not by a recent storm.
</P>
<P>(D) Upper limit of wet sand.
</P>
<P>(3) Distance measurements from the threatened structure to the nearest points on the reference features. These measurements should be taken from all photographed reference features to the closest point on the supporting foundation. For purposes of making this measurement, decks, stairs, and other exterior attachments that do not contribute to the structural support of the building are not considered part of the structure. The measurements shall be taken horizontally with a tape and recorded to the nearest foot. The date and time of the measurement shall be noted. The location of the measurements (i.e., reference feature and closest structural member) shall be identified on the appropriate photograph or sketch of the site. If some or all of the reference features coincide, this shall also be noted and identified on the photographs. Reference features landward of the structure need not be measured, but shall be noted on the photographs.
</P>
<P>(4) A determination of the average annual erosion rate at the site and a copy of the pertinent section of the reference document used to obtain the annual erosion rate at the site.
</P>
<P>(5) Copy of the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map panel annotated with the location of the threatened structure.
</P>
<P>(6) In the event that a structure is not situated within a “zone of imminent collapse” using the criteria and procedures in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section, then the State may submit other scientific and technical data, in addition to the information described in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section, that would reveal unusual erosive or stability conditions at the site. Such data must include engineering analyses or reports performed on the structure or site which evaluates local rates of erosion, or the condition or stability of the structure's foundation including supporting soil.
</P>
<P>(c) In the case of structures planned to be relocated, a certification as to whether the proposed relocation site is outside the 30-year setback for 1-4 family residential structures, or outside the 60-year setback for all other structures, must also be submitted by the State.

<HEAD>§ 65.5   Revision to special hazard area boundaries with no change to base flood elevation determinations.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Data requirements for topographic changes.</I> In many areas of special flood hazard (excluding V zones and floodways) it may be feasible to elevate areas with engineered earthen fill above the base flood elevation. Scientific and technical information to support a request to gain exclusion from an area of special flood hazard of a structure or parcel of land that has been elevated by the placement of engineered earthen fill will include the following: 
</P>
<P>(1) A copy of the recorded deed indicating the legal description of the property and the official recordation information (deed book volume and page number) and bearing the seal of the appropriate recordation official (<I>e.g.,</I> County Clerk or Recorder of Deeds). 
</P>
<P>(2) If the property is recorded on a plat map, a copy of the recorded plat indicating both the location of the property and the official recordation information (plat book volume and page number) and bearing the seal of the appropriate recordation official. If the property is not recorded on a plat map, FEMA requires copies of the tax map or other suitable maps to help in locating the property accurately. 
</P>
<P>(3) A topographic map or other information indicating existing ground elevations and the date of fill. FEMA's determination to exclude a legally defined parcel of land or a structure from the area of special flood hazard will be based upon a comparison of the base flood elevations to the lowest ground elevation of the parcel or the lowest adjacent grade to the structure. If the lowest ground elevation of the entire legally defined parcel of land or the lowest adjacent grade to the structure are at or above the elevations of the base flood, FEMA will exclude the parcel and/or structure from the area of special flood hazard. 
</P>
<P>(4) Written assurance by the participating community that they have complied with the appropriate minimum floodplain management requirements under § 60.3. This includes the requirements that: 
</P>
<P>(i) Existing residential structures built in the SFHA have their lowest floor elevated to or above the base flood; 
</P>
<P>(ii) The participating community has determined that the land and any existing or proposed structures to be removed from the SFHA are “reasonably safe from flooding”, and that they have on file, available upon request by FEMA, all supporting analyses and documentation used to make that determination; 
</P>
<P>(iii) The participating community has issued permits for all existing and proposed construction or other development; and
</P>
<P>(iv) All necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies where approval is required by Federal, State, or local law. 
</P>
<P>(5) If the community cannot assure that it has complied with the appropriate minimum floodplain management requirements under § 60.3, of this chapter, the map revision request will be deferred until the community remedies all violations to the maximum extent possible through coordination with FEMA. Once the remedies are in place, and the community assures that the land and structures are “reasonably safe from flooding,” we will process a revision to the SFHA using the criteria set forth in § 65.5(a). The community must maintain on file, and make available upon request by FEMA, all supporting analyses and documentation used in determining that the land or structures are “reasonably safe from flooding.” 
</P>
<P>(6) Data to substantiate the base flood elevation. If we complete a Flood Insurance Study (FIS), we will use those data to substantiate the base flood elevation. Otherwise, the community may submit data provided by an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resources Conservation Service, State and local water resource departments, or technical data prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer. If base flood elevations have not previously been established, we may also request hydrologic and hydraulic calculations. 
</P>
<P>(7) A revision of floodplain delineations based on fill must demonstrate that any such fill does not result in a floodway encroachment. 
</P>
<P>(b) <I>New topographic data.</I> A community may also follow the procedures described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section to request a map revision when no physical changes have occurred in the area of special flood hazard, when no fill has been placed, and when the natural ground elevations are at or above the elevations of the base flood, where new topographic maps are more detailed or more accurate than the current map. 
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Certification requirements.</I> A registered professional engineer or licensed land surveyor must certify the items required in paragraphs (a)(3) and (6) and (b) of this section. Such certifications are subject to the provisions under § 65.2. 
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Submission procedures.</I> Submit all requests to the appropriate address serving the community's geographic area or to the FEMA Headquarters Office in Washington, DC.

<HEAD>§ 65.6   Revision of base flood elevation determinations.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General conditions and data requirements.</I> (1) The supporting data must include all the information FEMA needs to review and evaluate the request. This may involve the requestor's performing new hydrologic and hydraulic analysis and delineation of new flood plain boundaries and floodways, as necessary.
</P>
<P>(2) To avoid discontinuities between the revised and unrevised flood data, the necessary hydrologic and hydraulic analyses submitted by the map revision requestor must be extensive enough to ensure that a logical transition can be shown between the revised flood elevations, flood plain boundaries, and floodways and those developed previously for areas not affected by the revision. Unless it is demonstrated that it would not be appropriate, the revised and unrevised base flood elevations must match within one-half foot where such transitions occur.
</P>
<P>(3) Revisions cannot be made based on the effects of proposed projects or future conditions. Section 65.8 of this subchapter contains provisions for obtaining conditional approval of proposed projects that may effect map changes when they are completed.
</P>
<P>(4) The datum and date of releveling of benchmarks, if any, to which the elevations are referenced must be indicated.
</P>
<P>(5) Maps will not be revised when discharges change as a result of the use of an alternative methodology or data for computing flood discharges unless the change is statistically significant as measured by a confidence limits analysis of the new discharge estimates.
</P>
<P>(6) Any computer program used to perform hydrologic or hydraulic analyses in support of a flood insurance map revision must meet all of the following criteria:
</P>
<P>(i) It must have been reviewed and accepted by a governmental agency responsible for the implementation of programs for flood control and/or the regulation of flood plain lands. For computer programs adopted by non-Federal agencies, certification by a responsible agency official must be provided which states that the program has been reviewed, tested, and accepted by that agency for purposes of design of flood control structures or flood plain land use regulation.
</P>
<P>(ii) It must be well-documented including source codes and user's manuals.
</P>
<P>(iii) It must be available to FEMA and all present and future parties impacted by flood insurance mapping developed or amended through the use of the program. For programs not generally available from a Federal agency, the source code and user's manuals must be sent to FEMA free of charge, with fully-documented permission from the owner that FEMA may release the code and user's manuals to such impacted parties.
</P>
<P>(7) A revised hydrologic analysis for flooding sources with established base flood elevations must include evaluation of the same recurrence interval(s) studied in the effective FIS, such as the 10-, 50-, 100-, and 500-year flood discharges.
</P>
<P>(8) A revised hydraulic analysis for a flooding source with established base flood elevations must include evaluation of the same recurrence interval(s) studied in the effective FIS, such as the 10-, 50-, 100-, and 500-year flood elevations, and of the floodway. Unless the basis of the request is the use of an alternative hydraulic methodology or the requestor can demonstrate that the data of the original hydraulic computer model is unavailable or its use is inappropriate, the analysis shall be made using the same hydraulic computer model used to develop the base flood elevations shown on the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and updated to show present conditions in the flood plain. Copies of the input and output data from the original and revised hydraulic analyses shall be submitted.
</P>
<P>(9) A hydrologic or hydraulic analysis for a flooding source without established base flood elevations may be performed for only the 100-year flood.
</P>
<P>(10) A revision of flood plain delineations based on topographic changes must demonstrate that any topographic changes have not resulted in a floodway encroachment.
</P>
<P>(11) Delineations of flood plain boundaries for a flooding source with established base flood elevations must provide both the 100- and 500-year flood plain boundaries. For flooding sources without established base flood elevations, only 100-year flood plain boundaries need be submitted. These boundaries should be shown on a topographic map of suitable scale and contour interval.
</P>
<P>(12) If a community or other party seeks recognition from FEMA, on its FHBM or FIRM, that an altered or relocated portion of a watercourse provides protection from, or mitigates potential hazards of, the base flood, the Federal Insurance Administrator may request specific documentation from the community certifying that, and describing how, the provisions of § 60.3(b)(7) of this subchapter will be met for the particular watercourse involved. This documentation, which may be in the form of a written statement from the Community Chief Executive Officer, an ordinance, or other legislative action, shall describe the nature of the maintenance activities to be performed, the frequency with which they will be performed, and the title of the local community official who will be responsible for assuring that the maintenance activities are accomplished.
</P>
<P>(13) Notwithstanding any other provisions of § 65.6, a community may submit, in lieu of the documentation specified in § 65.6(a)(12), certification by a registered professional engineer that the project has been designed to retain its flood carrying capacity without periodic maintenance.
</P>
<P>(14) The participating community must provide written assurance that they have complied with the appropriate minimum floodplain management requirements under § 60.3 of this chapter. This includes the requirements that:

<HEAD>§ 65.10   Mapping of areas protected by levee systems.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> For purposes of the NFIP, FEMA will only recognize in its flood hazard and risk mapping effort those levee systems that meet, and continue to meet, minimum design, operation, and maintenance standards that are consistent with the level of protection sought through the comprehensive flood plain management criteria established by § 60.3 of this subchapter. Accordingly, this section describes the types of information FEMA needs to recognize, on NFIP maps, that a levee system provides protection from the base flood. This information must be supplied to FEMA by the community or other party seeking recognition of such a levee system at the time a flood risk study or restudy is conducted, when a map revision under the provisions of part 65 of this subchapter is sought based on a levee system, and upon request by the Federal Insurance Administrator during the review of previously recognized structures. The FEMA review will be for the sole purpose of establishing appropriate risk zone determinations for NFIP maps and shall not constitute a determination by FEMA as to how a structure or system will perform in a flood event.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Design criteria.</I> For levees to be recognized by FEMA, evidence that adequate design and operation and maintenance systems are in place to provide reasonable assurance that protection from the base flood exists must be provided. The following requirements must be met:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Freeboard.</I> (i) Riverine levees must provide a minimum freeboard of three feet above the water-surface level of the base flood. An additional one foot above the minimum is required within 100 feet in either side of structures (such as bridges) riverward of the levee or wherever the flow is constricted. An additional one-half foot above the minimum at the upstream end of the levee, tapering to not less than the minimum at the downstream end of the levee, is also required.
</P>
<P>(ii) Occasionally, exceptions to the minimum riverine freeboard requirement described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, may be approved. Appropriate engineering analyses demonstrating adequate protection with a lesser freeboard must be submitted to support a request for such an exception. The material presented must evaluate the uncertainty in the estimated base flood elevation profile and include, but not necessarily be limited to an assessment of statistical confidence limits of the 100-year discharge; changes in stage-discharge relationships; and the sources, potential, and magnitude of debris, sediment, and ice accumulation. It must be also shown that the levee will remain structurally stable during the base flood when such additional loading considerations are imposed. Under no circumstances will freeboard of less than two feet be accepted.
</P>
<P>(iii) For coastal levees, the freeboard must be established at one foot above the height of the one percent wave or the maximum wave runup (whichever is greater) associated with the 100-year stillwater surge elevation at the site.
</P>
<P>(iv) Occasionally, exceptions to the minimum coastal levee freeboard requirement described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, may be approved. Appropriate engineering analyses demonstrating adequate protection with a lesser freeboard must be submitted to support a request for such an exception. The material presented must evaluate the uncertainty in the estimated base flood loading conditions. Particular emphasis must be placed on the effects of wave attack and overtopping on the stability of the levee. Under no circumstances, however, will a freeboard of less than two feet above the 100-year stillwater surge elevation be accepted.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Closures.</I> All openings must be provided with closure devices that are structural parts of the system during operation and design according to sound engineering practice.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Embankment protection.</I> Engineering analyses must be submitted that demonstrate that no appreciable erosion of the levee embankment can be expected during the base flood, as a result of either currents or waves, and that anticipated erosion will not result in failure of the levee embankment or foundation directly or indirectly through reduction of the seepage path and subsequent instability. The factors to be addressed in such analyses include, but are not limited to: Expected flow velocities (especially in constricted areas); expected wind and wave action; ice loading; impact of debris; slope protection techniques; duration of flooding at various stages and velocities; embankment and foundation materials; levee alignment, bends, and transitions; and levee side slopes.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Embankment and foundation stability.</I> Engineering analyses that evaluate levee embankment stability must be submitted. The analyses provided shall evaluate expected seepage during loading conditions associated with the base flood and shall demonstrate that seepage into or through the levee foundation and embankment will not jeopardize embankment or foundation stability. An alternative analysis demonstrating that the levee is designed and constructed for stability against loading conditions for Case IV as defined in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) manual, “Design and Construction of Levees” (EM 1110-2-1913, Chapter 6, Section II), may be used. The factors that shall be addressed in the analyses include: Depth of flooding, duration of flooding, embankment geometry and length of seepage path at critical locations, embankment and foundation materials, embankment compaction, penetrations, other design factors affecting seepage (such as drainage layers), and other design factors affecting embankment and foundation stability (such as berms).
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Settlement.</I> Engineering analyses must be submitted that assess the potential and magnitude of future losses of freeboard as a result of levee settlement and demonstrate that freeboard will be maintained within the minimum standards set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. This analysis must address embankment loads, compressibility of embankment soils, compressibility of foundation soils, age of the levee system, and construction compaction methods. In addition, detailed settlement analysis using procedures such as those described in the COE manual, “Soil Mechanics Design—Settlement Analysis” (EM 1100-2-1904) must be submitted.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Interior drainage.</I> An analysis must be submitted that identifies the source(s) of such flooding, the extent of the flooded area, and, if the average depth is greater than one foot, the water-surface elevation(s) of the base flood. This analysis must be based on the joint probability of interior and exterior flooding and the capacity of facilities (such as drainage lines and pumps) for evacuating interior floodwaters.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Other design criteria.</I> In unique situations, such as those where the levee system has relatively high vulnerability, FEMA may require that other design criteria and analyses be submitted to show that the levees provide adequate protection. In such situations, sound engineering practice will be the standard on which FEMA will base its determinations. FEMA will also provide the rationale for requiring this additional information.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Operation plans and criteria.</I> For a levee system to be recognized, the operational criteria must be as described below. All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage, whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially adopted operation manual, a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or when the manual for a previously recognized system is revised in any manner. All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a Federal or State agency, an agency created by Federal or State law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Closures.</I> Operation plans for closures must include the following:
</P>
<P>(i) Documentation of the flood warning system, under the jurisdiction of Federal, State, or community officials, that will be used to trigger emergency operation activities and demonstration that sufficient flood warning time exists for the completed operation of all closure structures, including necessary sealing, before floodwaters reach the base of the closure.
</P>
<P>(ii) A formal plan of operation including specific actions and assignments of responsibility by individual name or title.
</P>
<P>(iii) Provisions for periodic operation, at not less than one-year intervals, of the closure structure for testing and training purposes.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Interior drainage systems.</I> Interior drainage systems associated with levee systems usually include storage areas, gravity outlets, pumping stations, or a combination thereof. These drainage systems will be recognized by FEMA on NFIP maps for flood protection purposes only if the following minimum criteria are included in the operation plan:
</P>
<P>(i) Documentation of the flood warning system, under the jurisdiction of Federal, State, or community officials, that will be used to trigger emergency operation activities and demonstration that sufficient flood warning time exists to permit activation of mechanized portions of the drainage system.
</P>
<P>(ii) A formal plan of operation including specific actions and assignments of responsibility by individual name or title.
</P>
<P>(iii) Provision for manual backup for the activation of automatic systems.
</P>
<P>(iv) Provisions for periodic inspection of interior drainage systems and periodic operation of any mechanized portions for testing and training purposes. No more than one year shall elapse between either the inspections or the operations.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Other operation plans and criteria.</I> Other operating plans and criteria may be required by FEMA to ensure that adequate protection is provided in specific situations. In such cases, sound emergency management practice will be the standard upon which FEMA determinations will be based.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Maintenance plans and criteria.</I> For levee systems to be recognized as providing protection from the base flood, the maintenance criteria must be as described herein. Levee systems must be maintained in accordance with an officially adopted maintenance plan, and a copy of this plan must be provided to FEMA by the owner of the levee system when recognition is being sought or when the plan for a previously recognized system is revised in any manner. All maintenance activities must be under the jurisdiction of a Federal or State agency, an agency created by Federal or State law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP that must assume ultimate responsibility for maintenance. This plan must document the formal procedure that ensures that the stability, height, and overall integrity of the levee and its associated structures and systems are maintained. At a minimum, maintenance plans shall specify the maintenance activities to be performed, the frequency of their performance, and the person by name or title responsible for their performance.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Certification requirements.</I> Data submitted to support that a given levee system complies with the structural requirements set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section must be certified by a registered professional engineer. Also, certified as-built plans of the levee must be submitted. Certifications are subject to the definition given at § 65.2 of this subchapter. In lieu of these structural requirements, a Federal agency with responsibility for levee design may certify that the levee has been adequately designed and constructed to provide protection against the base flood.

<HEAD>§ 65.13   Mapping and map revisions for areas subject to alluvial fan flooding.</HEAD>
<P>This section describes the procedures to be followed and the types of information FEMA needs to recognize on a NFIP map that a structural flood control measure provides protection from the base flood in an area subject to alluvial fan flooding. This information must be supplied to FEMA by the community or other party seeking recognition of such a flood control measure at the time a flood risk study or restudy is conducted, when a map revision under the provisions of part 65 of this subchapter is sought, and upon request by the Federal Insurance Administrator during the review of previously recognized flood control measures. The FEMA review will be for the sole purpose of establishing appropriate risk zone determinations for NFIP maps and shall not constitute a determination by FEMA as to how the flood control measure will perform in a flood event.
</P>
<P>(a) The applicable provisions of §§ 65.2, 65.3, 65.4, 65.6, 65.8 and 65.10 shall also apply to FIRM revisions involving alluvial fan flooding.
</P>
<P>(b) The provisions of § 65.5 regarding map revisions based on fill and the provisions of part 70 of this chapter shall not apply to FIRM revisions involving alluvial fan flooding. In general, elevations of a parcel of land or a structure by fill or other means, will not serve as a basis for removing areas subject to alluvial fan flooding from an area of special food hazards.
</P>
<P>(c) FEMA will credit on NFIP maps only major structural flood control measures whose design and construction are supported by sound engineering analyses which demonstrate that the measures will effectively eliminate alluvial fan flood hazards from the area protected by such measures. The provided analyses must include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:
</P>
<P>(1) Engineering analyses that quantify the discharges and volumes of water, debris, and sediment movement associated with the flood that has a one-percent probability of being exceeded in any year at the apex under current watershed conditions and under potential adverse conditions (e.g., deforestation of the watershed by fire). The potential for debris flow and sediment movement must be assessed using an engineering method acceptable to FEMA. The assessment should consider the characteristics and availability of sediment in the drainage basin above the apex and on the alluvial fan.
</P>
<P>(2) Engineering analyses showing that the measures will accommodate the estimated peak discharges and volumes of water, debris, and sediment, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and will withstand the associated hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces.
</P>
<P>(3) Engineering analyses showing that the measures have been designed to withstand the potential erosion and scour associated with estimated discharges.
</P>
<P>(4) Engineering analyses or evidence showing that the measures will provide protection from hazards associated with the possible relocation of flow paths from other parts of the fan.
</P>
<P>(5) Engineering analyses that assess the effect of the project on flood hazards, including depth and velocity of floodwaters and scour and sediment deposition, on other areas of the fan.
</P>
<P>(6) Engineering analyses demonstrating that flooding from sources other than the fan apex, including local runoff, is either insignificant or has been accounted for in the design.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Coordination.</I> FEMA will recognize measures that are adequately designed and constructed, provided that: evidence is submitted to show that the impact of the measures on flood hazards in all areas of the fan (including those not protected by the flood control measures), and the design and maintenance requirements of the measures, were reviewed and approved by the impacted communities, and also by State and local agencies that have jurisdiction over flood control activities.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Operation and maintenance plans and criteria.</I> The requirements for operation and maintenance of flood control measures on areas subject to alluvial fan flooding shall be those specified under § 65.10, paragraphs (c) and (d), when applicable.

<HEAD>§ 65.14   Remapping of areas for which local flood protection systems no longer provide base flood protection.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> (1) This section describes the procedures to follow and the types of information FEMA requires to designate flood control restoration zones. A community may be eligible to apply for this zone designation if the Federal Insurance Administrator determines that it is engaged in the process of restoring a flood protection system that was:
</P>
<P>(i) Constructed using Federal funds;
</P>
<P>(ii) Recognized as providing base flood protection on the community's effective FIRM; and
</P>
<P>(iii) Decertified by a Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction.
</P>
<P>(2) Where the Federal Insurance Administrator determines that a community is in the process of restoring its flood protection system to provide base flood protection, a FIRM will be prepared that designates the temporary flood hazard areas as a flood control restoration zone (Zone AR). Existing special flood hazard areas shown on the community's effective FIRM that are further inundated by Zone AR flooding shall be designated as a “dual” flood insurance rate zone, Zone AR/AE or AR/AH with Zone AR base flood elevations, and AE or AH with base flood elevations and Zone AR/AO with Zone AR base flood elevations and Zone AO with flood depths, or Zone AR/A with Zone AR base flood elevations and Zone A without base flood elevations.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Limitations.</I> A community may have a flood control restoration zone designation only once while restoring a flood protection system. This limitation does not preclude future flood control restoration zone designations should a fully restored, certified, and accredited system become decertified for a second or subsequent time.
</P>
<P>(1) A community that receives Federal funds for the purpose of designing or constructing, or both, the restoration project must complete restoration or meet the requirements of 44 CFR 61.12 within a specified period, not to exceed a maximum of 10 years from the date of submittal of the community's application for designation of a flood control restoration zone.
</P>
<P>(2) A community that does not receive Federal funds for the purpose of constructing the restoration project must complete restoration within a specified period, not to exceed a maximum of 5 years from the date of submittal of the community's application for designation of a flood control restoration zone. Such a community is not eligible for the provisions of § 61.12. The designated restoration period may not be extended beyond the maximum allowable under this limitation.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Exclusions.</I> The provisions of these regulations do not apply in a coastal high hazard area as defined in 44 CFR 59.1, including areas that would be subject to coastal high hazards as a result of the decertification of a flood protection system shown on the community's effective FIRM as providing base flood protection.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Effective date for risk premium rates.</I> The effective date for any risk premium rates established for Zone AR shall be the effective date of the revised FIRM showing Zone AR designations.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Application and submittal requirements for designation of a flood control restoration zone.</I> A community must submit a written request to the Federal Insurance Administrator, signed by the community's Chief Executive Officer, for a flood plain designation as a flood control restoration zone. The request must include a legislative action by the community requesting the designation. The Federal Insurance Administrator will not initiate any action to designate flood control restoration zones without receipt of the formal request from the community that complies with all requirements of this section. The Federal Insurance Administrator reserves the right to request additional information from the community to support or further document the community's formal request for designation of a flood control restoration zone, if deemed necessary.
</P>
<P>(1) At a minimum, the request from a community that receives Federal funds for the purpose of designing, constructing, or both, the restoration project must include:
</P>
<P>(i) A statement whether, to the best of the knowledge of the community's Chief Executive Officer, the flood protection system is currently the subject matter of litigation before any Federal, State or local court or administrative agency, and if so, the purpose of that litigation;
</P>
<P>(ii) A statement whether the community has previously requested a determination with respect to the same subject matter from the Federal Insurance Administrator, and if so, a statement that details the disposition of such previous request;
</P>
<P>(iii) A statement from the community and certification by a Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction that the existing flood control system shown on the effective FIRM was originally built using Federal funds, that it no longer provides base flood protection, but that it continues to provide protection from the flood having at least a 3-percent chance of occurrence during any given year;
</P>
<P>(iv) An official map of the community or legal description, with supporting documentation, that the community will adopt as part of its flood plain management measures, which designates developed areas as defined in § 59.1 and as further defined in § 60.3(f).
</P>
<P>(v) A restoration plan to return the system to a level of base flood protection. At a minimum, this plan must:
</P>
<P>(A) List all important project elements, such as acquisition of permits, approvals, and contracts and construction schedules of planned features;
</P>
<P>(B) Identify anticipated start and completion dates for each element, as well as significant milestones and dates;
</P>
<P>(C) Identify the date on which “as built” drawings and certification for the completed restoration project will be submitted. This date must provide for a restoration period not to exceed the maximum allowable restoration period for the flood protection system, or;
</P>
<P>(D) Identify the date on which the community will submit a request for a finding of adequate progress that meets all requirements of § 61.12. This date may not exceed the maximum allowable restoration period for the flood protection system;
</P>
<P>(vi) A statement identifying the local project sponsor responsible for restoration of the flood protection system;
</P>
<P>(vii) A copy of a study, performed by a Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction in consultation with the local project sponsor, which demonstrates a Federal interest in restoration of the system and which deems that the flood protection system is restorable to a level of base flood protection.
</P>
<P>(viii) A joint statement from the Federal agency responsible for flood protection design or construction involved in restoration of the flood protection system and the local project sponsor certifying that the design and construction of the flood control system involves Federal funds, and that the restoration of the flood protection system will provide base flood protection;
</P>
<P>(2) At a minimum, the request from a community that receives no Federal funds for the purpose of constructing the restoration project must:
</P>
<P>(i) Meet the requirements of § 65.14(e)(1)(i) through (iv);
</P>
<P>(ii) Include a restoration plan to return the system to a level of base flood protection. At a minimum, this plan must:
</P>
<P>(A) List all important project elements, such as acquisition of permits, approvals, and contracts and construction schedules of planned features;
</P>
<P>(B) Identify anticipated start and completion dates for each element, as well as significant milestones and dates; and
</P>
<P>(C) Identify the date on which “as built” drawings and certification for the completed restoration project will be submitted. This date must provide for a restoration period not to exceed the maximum allowable restoration period for the flood protection system;
</P>
<P>(iii) Include a statement identifying the local agency responsible for restoration of the flood protection system;
</P>
<P>(iv) Include a copy of a study, certified by registered Professional Engineer, that demonstrates that the flood protection system is restorable to provide protection from the base flood;
</P>
<P>(v) Include a statement from the local agency responsible for restoration of the flood protection system certifying that the restored flood protection system will meet the applicable requirements of Part 65; and
</P>
<P>(vi) Include a statement from the local agency responsible for restoration of the flood protection system that identifies the source of funds for the purpose of constructing the restoration project and a percentage of the total funds contributed by each source. The statement must demonstrate, at a minimum, that 100 percent of the total financial project cost of the completed flood protection system has been appropriated.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Review and response by the Federal Insurance Administrator.</I> The review and response by the Federal Insurance Administrator shall be in accordance with procedures specified in § 65.9.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Requirements for maintaining designation of a flood control restoration zone.</I> During the restoration period, the community and the cost-sharing Federal agency, if any, must certify annually to the FEMA Regional Office having jurisdiction that the restoration will be completed in accordance with the restoration plan within the time period specified by the plan. In addition, the community and the cost-sharing Federal agency, if any, will update the restoration plan and will identify any permitting or construction problems that will delay the project completion from the restoration plan previously submitted to the Federal Insurance Administrator. The FEMA Regional Office having jurisdiction will make an annual assessment and recommendation to the Federal Insurance Administrator as to the viability of the restoration plan and will conduct periodic on-site inspections of the flood protection system under restoration.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Procedures for removing flood control restoration zone designation due to adequate progress or complete restoration of the flood protection system.</I> At any time during the restoration period:
</P>
<P>(1) A community that receives Federal funds for the purpose of designing, constructing, or both, the restoration project shall provide written evidence of certification from a Federal agency having flood protection design or construction responsibility that the necessary improvements have been completed and that the system has been restored to provide protection from the base flood, or submit a request for a finding of adequate progress that meets all requirements of § 61.12. If the Administrator determines that adequate progress has been made, FEMA will revise the zone designation from a flood control restoration zone designation to Zone A99.
</P>
<P>(2) After the improvements have been completed, certified by a Federal agency as providing base flood protection, and reviewed by FEMA, FEMA will revise the FIRM to reflect the completed flood control system.
</P>
<P>(3) A community that receives no Federal funds for the purpose of constructing the restoration project must provide written evidence that the restored flood protection system meets the requirements of part 65. A community that receives no Federal funds for the purpose of constructing the restoration project is not eligible for a finding of adequate progress under § 61.12.
</P>
<P>(4) After the improvements have been completed and reviewed by FEMA, FEMA will revise the FIRM to reflect the completed flood protection system.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Procedures for removing flood control restoration zone designation due to non-compliance with the restoration schedule or as a result of a finding that satisfactory progress is not being made to complete the restoration.</I> At any time during the restoration period, should the Federal Insurance Administrator determine that the restoration will not be completed in accordance with the time frame specified in the restoration plan, or that satisfactory progress is not being made to restore the flood protection system to provide complete flood protection in accordance with the restoration plan, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall notify the community and the responsible Federal agency, in writing, of the determination, the reasons for that determination, and that the FIRM will be revised to remove the flood control restoration zone designation. Within thirty (30) days of such notice, the community may submit written information that provides assurance that the restoration will be completed in accordance with the time frame specified in the restoration plan, or that satisfactory progress is being made to restore complete protection in accordance with the restoration plan, or that, with reasonable certainty, the restoration will be completed within the maximum allowable restoration period. On the basis of this information the Federal Insurance Administrator may suspend the decision to revise the FIRM to remove the flood control restoration zone designation. If the community does not submit any information, or if, based on a review of the information submitted, there is sufficient cause to find that the restoration will not be completed as provided for in the restoration plan, the Federal Insurance Administrator shall revise the FIRM, in accordance with 44 CFR Part 67, and shall remove the flood control restoration zone designations and shall redesignate those areas as Zone A1-30, AE, AH, AO, or A.

<HEAD>§ 65.16   Standard Flood Hazard Determination Form and Instructions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Section 528 of the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 1365(a)) directs FEMA to develop a standard form for determining, in the case of a loan secured by improved real estate or a mobile home, whether the building or mobile home is located in an area identified by the Director as an area having special flood hazards and in which flood insurance under this title is available. The purpose of the form is to determine whether a building or mobile home is located within an identified Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), whether flood insurance is required, and whether federal flood insurance is available. Use of this form will ensure that required flood insurance coverage is purchased for structures located in an SFHA, and will assist federal entities for lending regulation in assuring compliance with these purchase requirements.
</P>
<P>(b) The form is available by written request to Federal Emergency Management Agency, PO Box 2012, Jessup, MD 20794; ask for the Standard Flood Hazard Determination form. It is also available by fax-on-demand; call (202) 646-3362, form #23103. Finally, the form is available through the Internet at <I>http://www.fema.gov/nfip/mpurfi.htm.</I>

</P>
<P>(b) <I>Data requirements.</I> (1) If an appellant believes the proposed base flood elevations are technically incorrect due to a mathematical or measurement error or changed physical conditions, then the specific source of the error must be identified. Supporting data must be furnished to FEMA including certifications by a registered professional engineer or licensed land surveyor, of the new data necessary for FEMA to conduct a reanalysis.
</P>
<P>(2) If an appellant believes that the proposed base flood elevations are technically incorrect due to error in application of hydrologic, hydraulic or other methods or use of inferior data in applying such methods, the appeal must demonstrate technical incorrectness by:
</P>
<P>(i) Identifying the purported error in the application or the inferior data.
</P>
<P>(ii) Supporting why the application is incorrect or data is inferior.
</P>
<P>(iii) Providing an application of the same basic methods utilized by FEMA but with the changes itemized.

</P>
<P>(vi) Providing documentation of all locations where the appellant's base flood elevations are different from FEMA's.

<P>(3) If any appellant believes the proposed base flood elevations are scientifically incorrect, the appeal must demonstrate scientific incorrectness by:
</P>
<P>(i) Identifying the methods, or assumptions purported to be scientifically incorrect.

<P>Except as otherwise provided in this part, the definitions in 44 CFR part 59 are applicable to this part. For the purposes of this part, the products are defined as follows:
</P>
<P><I>CLOMA.</I> A CLOMA is FEMA's comment on a proposed structure or group of structures that would, upon construction, be located on existing natural ground above the base (1-percent-annual-chance) flood elevation on a portion of a legally defined parcel of land that is partially inundated by the base flood.
</P>
<P><I>CLOMR.</I> A CLOMR is FEMA's comment on a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood elevations, or the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).
</P>
<P><I>CLOMR-F.</I> A CLOMR-F is FEMA's comment on a proposed project that would, upon construction, result in a modification of the SFHA through the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
</P>
<P><I>LOMR.</I> A LOMR is FEMA's modification to an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), or Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM), or both. LOMRs are generally based on the implementation of physical measures that affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood elevations, or the SFHA. The LOMR officially revises the FIRM or FBFM, and sometimes the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report, and, when appropriate, includes a description of the modifications. The LOMR is generally accompanied by an annotated copy of the affected portions of the FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report.
</P>
<P><I>LOMR-F.</I> A LOMR-F is FEMA's modification of the SFHA shown on the FIRM based on the placement of fill outside the existing regulatory floodway.
</P>
<P><I>PMR.</I> A PMR is FEMA's physical revision and republication of an effective FIRM, FBFM, or FIS report. PMRs are generally based on physical measures that affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood elevations, or the SFHA.

</P>
<P>(4) Consist of a self-insurance fund, or a commercial policy of insurance or reinsurance, for which provision is made in statute or regulation and that is funded by periodic premiums or charges allocated for state-owned structures and their contents in areas identified by the Federal Insurance Administrator as A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E Zones. The person or persons responsible for such self-insurance fund shall report on its status to the chief executive authority of the State, or to the legislature, or both, not less frequently than annually. The loss experience shall be shown for each calendar or fiscal year from inception to current date based upon loss and loss adjustment expense incurred during each separate calendar or fiscal year compared to the premiums or charges for each of the respective calendar or fiscal years.

The Federal Insurance Administrator may, subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, accept and approve in lieu of, and as the reasonable equivalent of the self-insurance fund, an enforceable commitment of funds by the State, the enforceability of which shall be certified to by the State's Attorney General, or other principal legal officer. Such funds, or enforceable commitment of funds in amounts not less than the limits of coverage that would be applicable under Standard Flood Insurance Policies, shall be used by the State for the repair or restoration of State-owned structures and their contents damaged as a result of flood-related losses occurring in areas identified by the Federal Insurance Administrator as A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, A99, M, V, VO, V1-30, VE, and E Zones.

<HEAD>§ 77.7   Allowable costs.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> General policies for allowable costs for implementing awards and subawards are addressed in 2 CFR 200.101, 200.102, 200.400-200.476.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Eligible management costs</I>—(i) <I>Recipient.</I> Recipients are eligible to receive management costs (direct and indirect administrative costs pursuant to 2 CFR part 200 subpart E) consisting of a maximum of 10 percent of the planning and project activities awarded to the recipient, each fiscal year under FMA. These costs must be included in the application to FEMA.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Subrecipient.</I> Subapplicants may include a maximum of 5 percent of the total funds requested for their subapplication for management costs to support the implementation of their planning or project activity. These costs must be included in the subapplication to the recipient.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Indirect costs.</I> Indirect costs of administering the FMA program are eligible as part of the 10 percent management costs for the recipient or the 5 percent management costs of the subrecipient, but in no case do they make the recipient eligible for additional management costs that exceed the caps identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In addition, all costs must be in accordance with the provisions of 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Pre-award costs.</I> FEMA may fund eligible pre-award costs related to developing the application or subapplication at its discretion and as funds are available. Recipients and subrecipients may be reimbursed for eligible pre-award costs for activities directly related to the development of the project or planning proposal. Costs associated with implementation of the activity but incurred prior to award are not eligible. Therefore, activities where implementation is initiated or completed prior to award are not eligible and will not be reimbursed.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Duplication of benefits.</I> Grant funds may not duplicate benefits received by or available to applicants, subapplicants and project participants from insurance, other assistance programs, legal awards, or any other source to address the same purpose. Such individual or entity must notify the recipient and FEMA of all benefits that it receives or anticipates from other sources for the same purpose. FEMA will reduce the subaward by the amounts available for the same purpose from another source.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Negligence or other tortious conduct.</I> FEMA grant funds are not available where an applicant, subapplicant, other project participant, or third party's negligence or intentional actions contributed to the conditions to be mitigated. If the applicant, subapplicant, or project participant suspects negligence or other tortious conduct by a third party for causing such condition, they are responsible for taking all reasonable steps to recover all costs attributable to the tortious conduct of the third party. FEMA generally considers such amounts to be duplicated benefits available for the same purpose, and will treat them consistent with paragraph (c) of this section.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Legal obligations.</I> FEMA grant funds are not available to satisfy or reimburse for legal obligations, such as those imposed by a legal settlement, court order, or State law.

<HEAD>§ 77.8   Grant administration.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> Recipients must comply with the requirements contained in 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002 and FEMA award requirements, including submission of performance and financial status reports. Recipients must also ensure that subrecipients are aware of and comply with 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Cost overruns.</I> (1) During the implementation of an approved grant, the recipient may find that actual costs are exceeding the approved award amount. While there is no guarantee of additional funding, FEMA will only consider requests made by the recipient to pay for such overruns if:
</P>
<P>(i) Funds are available to meet the requested increase in funding; and
</P>
<P>(ii) The amended grant award meets the eligibility requirements, including cost share requirements, identified in this section.
</P>
<P>(2) Recipients may use cost underruns from ongoing subawards to offset overruns incurred by another subaward(s) awarded under the same award. All costs for which funding is requested must have been included in the original subapplication's cost estimate. In cases where an underrun is not available to cover an overrun, the Administrator may, with justification from the recipient and subrecipient, use other available FMA funds to cover the cost overrun.
</P>
<P>(3) For all cost overruns that exceed the amount approved under the award, and which require additional Federal funds, the recipient must submit a written request with a recommendation, including a justification for the additional funding to the Regional Administrator for a determination. If approved, the Regional Administrator will increase the award through an amendment to the original award document.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Recapture.</I> At the time of closeout, FEMA will recapture any funds provided to a State or a community under this part if the applicant has not provided the appropriate matching funds, the approved project has not been completed within the timeframes specified in the grant agreement, or the completed project does not meet the criteria specified in this part.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Remedies for noncompliance.</I> FEMA may terminate an award or take other remedies for noncompliance in accordance with 2 CFR 200.339 through 200.343.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Reconsideration.</I> FEMA will reconsider determinations of noncompliance, additional award conditions, or its decision to terminate a Federal award. Requests for reconsideration must be made in writing to FEMA within 60 calendar days after receipt of a notice of the action, and in accordance with submission procedures set out in guidance. FEMA will notify the requester of the disposition of the request for reconsideration. If the decision is to grant the request for reconsideration, FEMA will take appropriate implementing action.

<HEAD>§ 80.7   General.</HEAD>
<P>A project involving property acquisition or the relocation of structures for open space is eligible for hazard mitigation assistance only if the subapplicant meets the pre-award requirements set forth in this subpart. A project may not be framed in a manner that has the effect of circumventing the requirements of this subpart.

<P>(a) <I>Allowable costs.</I> Eligible project costs may include compensation for the value of structures, for their relocation or demolition, for associated land, and associated costs. For land that is already held by an eligible entity, compensation for the land is not an allowable cost, but compensation for development rights may be allowable.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Pre-award costs.</I> FEMA may fund eligible pre-award project costs at its discretion and as funds are available. Recipients and subrecipients may be reimbursed for eligible pre-award costs for activities directly related to the development of the project proposal. These costs can only be incurred during the open application period of the respective grant program. Costs associated with implementation of the project but incurred prior to grant award are not eligible. Therefore, activities where implementation is initiated or completed prior to award are not eligible and will not be reimbursed.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Duplication of benefits.</I> Grant funds may not duplicate benefits received by or available to applicants, subapplicants and other project participants from insurance, other assistance programs, legal awards, or any other source to address the same purpose. Such individual or entity must notify the subapplicant and FEMA of all benefits that it receives, anticipates, or has available from other sources for the same purpose. FEMA will reduce the subaward by the amounts available for the same purpose from another source.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Negligence or other tortious conduct.</I> FEMA acquisition funds are not available where an applicant, subapplicant, other project participant, or third party's negligence or intentional actions contributed to the conditions to be mitigated. If the applicant, subapplicant, or project participant suspects negligence or other tortious conduct by a third party for causing such condition, they are responsible for taking all reasonable steps to recover all costs attributable to the tortious conduct of the third party. FEMA generally considers such amounts to be duplicated benefits available for the same purpose, and will treat them consistent with paragraph (c) of this section.
</P>
<P>(e) FEMA mitigation grant funds are not available to satisfy or reimburse for legal obligations, such as those imposed by a legal settlement, court order, or State law.

<P>(a) <I>Hazardous materials.</I> The subrecipient must take steps to ensure it does not acquire or include in the project properties contaminated with hazardous materials by seeking information from property owners and from other sources on the use and presence of contaminants affecting the property from owners of properties that are or were industrial or commercial, or adjacent to such. A contaminated property must be certified clean prior to participation. This excludes permitted disposal of incidental demolition and household hazardous wastes. FEMA mitigation grant funds may not be used for clean up or remediation of contaminated properties.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Clear title.</I> The subrecipient will obtain a title insurance policy demonstrating that fee title conveys to the subrecipient for each property to ensure that it acquires only a property with clear title. The property interest generally must transfer by a general warranty deed. Any incompatible easements or other encumbrances to the property must be extinguished before acquisition.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Purchase offer and supplemental payments.</I> (1) The amount of purchase offer is the current market value of the property or the market value of the property immediately before the relevant event affecting the property (“pre-event”).
</P>
<P>(i) The relevant event for Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act assistance under HMGP is the major disaster under which funds are available; for assistance under the Pre-disaster Mitigation program (PDM) (42 U.S.C. 5133), it is the most recent major disaster. Where multiple disasters have affected the same property, the recipient and subrecipient will determine which is the relevant event.
</P>
<P>(ii) The relevant event for assistance under the National Flood Insurance Act is the most recent event resulting in a National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) claim of at least $5,000.
</P>
<P>(2) The recipient should coordinate with the subrecipient in their determination of whether the valuation should be based on pre-event or current market value. Generally, the same method to determine market value should be used for all participants in the project.
</P>
<P>(3) A property owner who did not own the property at the time of the relevant event, or who is not a National of the United States or qualified alien, is not eligible for a purchase offer based on pre-event market value of the property. Subrecipients who offer pre-event market value to the property owner must have already obtained certification during the application process that the property owner is either a National of the United States or a qualified alien.
</P>
<P>(4) Certain tenants who must relocate as a result of the project are entitled to relocation benefits under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act (such as moving expenses, replacement housing rental payments, and relocation assistance advisory services) in accordance with 49 CFR part 24.
</P>
<P>(5) If a purchase offer for a residential property is less than the cost of the homeowner-occupant to purchase a comparable replacement dwelling outside the hazard-prone area in the same community, subrecipients for mitigation grant programs may make such a payment available in accordance with criteria determined by the Administrator.
</P>
<P>(6) The subrecipient must inform each property owner, in writing, of what it considers to be the market value of the property, the method of valuation and basis for the purchase offer, and the final offer amount. The offer will also clearly state that the property owner's participation in the project is voluntary.

<HEAD>§ 80.19   Land use and oversight.</HEAD>
<P>This section applies to acquisitions for open space projects to address flood hazards. If the Administrator determines to mitigate in other circumstances, he/she will adapt the provisions of this section as appropriate.
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Open space requirements.</I> The property must be dedicated and maintained in perpetuity as open space for the conservation of natural floodplain functions.
</P>
<P>(1) These uses may include: Parks for outdoor recreational activities; wetlands management; nature reserves; cultivation; grazing; camping (except where adequate warning time is not available to allow evacuation); unimproved, unpaved parking lots; buffer zones; and other uses FEMA determines compatible with this part.
</P>
<P>(i) Allowable uses generally do not include: Walled buildings, levees, dikes, or floodwalls, paved roads, highways, bridges, cemeteries, landfills, storage of any hazardous or toxic materials, above or below ground pumping and switching stations, above or below ground storage tanks, paved parking, off-site fill or other uses that obstruct the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain.
</P>
<P>(ii) In the rare circumstances where the Administrator has determined competing Federal interests were unavoidable and has analyzed floodplain impacts for compliance with § 60.3 of this subchapter or higher standards, the Administrator may find only USACE projects recognized by FEMA in 2000 and improvements to pre-existing Federal-aid transportation systems to be allowable uses.
</P>
<P>(2) No new structures or improvements will be built on the property except as indicated below:
</P>
<P>(i) A public facility that is open on all sides and functionally related to a designated open space or recreational use;
</P>
<P>(ii) A public restroom; or
</P>
<P>(iii) A structure that is compatible with open space and conserves the natural function of the floodplain, which the Administrator approves in writing before the construction of the structure begins.
</P>
<P>(3) Any improvements on the property must be in accordance with proper floodplain management policies and practices. Structures built on the property according to paragraph (a)(2) of this section must be floodproofed or elevated to at least the base flood level plus 1 foot of freeboard, or greater, if required by FEMA, or if required by any State or local ordinance, and in accordance with criteria established by the Administrator.
</P>
<P>(4) After the date of property settlement, no Federal entity or source may provide disaster assistance for any purpose with respect to the property, nor may any application for such assistance be made to any Federal entity or source.
</P>
<P>(5) The property is not eligible for coverage under the NFIP for damage to structures on the property occurring after the date of the property settlement, except for pre-existing structures being relocated off the property as a result of the project.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Subsequent transfer.</I> After acquiring the property interest, the subrecipient, including successors in interest, will convey any interest in the property only if the Regional Administrator, through the State, gives prior written approval of the transferee in accordance with this paragraph.
</P>
<P>(1) The request by the subrecipient, through the State, to the Regional Administrator must include a signed statement from the proposed transferee that it acknowledges and agrees to be bound by the terms of this section, and documentation of its status as a qualified conservation organization if applicable.
</P>
<P>(2) The subrecipient may convey a property interest only to a public entity or to a qualified conservation organization. However, the subrecipient may convey an easement or lease to a private individual or entity for purposes compatible with the uses described in paragraph (a) of this section, with the prior approval of the Regional Administrator, and so long as the conveyance does not include authority to control and enforce the terms and conditions of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) If title to the property is transferred to a public entity other than one with a conservation mission, it must be conveyed subject to a conservation easement that must be recorded with the deed and must incorporate all terms and conditions set forth in this section, including the easement holder's responsibility to enforce the easement. This must be accomplished by one of the following means:
</P>
<P>(i) The subrecipient will convey, in accordance with this paragraph (b), a conservation easement to an entity other than the title holder, which must be recorded with the deed, or
</P>
<P>(ii) At the time of title transfer, the subrecipient will retain such conservation easement, and record it with the deed.
</P>
<P>(4) Conveyance of any property interest must reference and incorporate the original deed restrictions providing notice of the conditions in this section and must incorporate a provision for the property interest to revert to the subrecipient or recipient in the event that the transferee ceases to exist or loses its eligible status under this section.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Inspection.</I> FEMA, its representatives and assigns, including the recipient will have the right to enter upon the property, at reasonable times and with reasonable notice, for the purpose of inspecting the property to ensure compliance with the terms of this part, the property conveyance and of the grant award.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Monitoring and reporting.</I> Every 3 years the subrecipient (in coordination with any current successor in interest) through the recipient, must submit to the FEMA Regional Administrator a report certifying that the subrecipient has inspected the property within the month preceding the report, and that the property continues to be maintained consistent with the provisions of this part, the property conveyance and the grant award.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Enforcement.</I> The subrecipient, recipient, FEMA, and their respective representatives, successors and assigns, are responsible for taking measures to bring the property back into compliance if the property is not maintained according to the terms of this part, the conveyance, and the grant award. The relative rights and responsibilities of FEMA, the recipient, the subrecipient, and subsequent holders of the property interest at the time of enforcement, include the following:
</P>
<P>(1) The recipient will notify the subrecipient and any current holder of the property interest in writing and advise them that they have 60 days to correct the violation. If the subrecipient or any current holder of the property interest fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to come into compliance with the terms of the grant within the 60-day period, the recipient will enforce the terms of the grant by taking any measures it deems appropriate, including but not limited to bringing an action at law or in equity in a court of competent jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>(2) FEMA, its representatives, and assignees may enforce the terms of the grant by taking any measures it deems appropriate, including but not limited to 1 or more of the following:
</P>
<P>(i) Withholding FEMA mitigation awards or assistance from the State and subrecipient; and current holder of the property interest.
</P>
<P>(ii) Requiring transfer of title. The subrecipient or the current holder of the property interest will bear the costs of bringing the property back into compliance with the terms of the grant; or
</P>
<P>(iii) Bringing an action at law or in equity in a court of competent jurisdiction against any or all of the following parties: The recipient, the subrecipient, and their respective successors.

<HEAD>§ 151.01   Purpose.</HEAD>
<P>Section 11 of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974, provides that “each fire service that engages in the fighting of a fire on property which is under the jurisdiction of the United States may file a claim with the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for the amount of direct expenses and direct losses incurred by such fire service as a result of fighting such fire.” This part, implements section 11 of the Act and governs the submission, determination, and appeal of claims under section 11.

<DIV8 N="§ 151.02" NODE="44:1.0.1.3.47.1.10.2" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 151.02   Scope.</HEAD>
<P>Fire services, in any State, may file claims for reimbursement under section 11 and this part for the direct expenses and losses which are additional firefighting costs over and above normal operating costs incurred while fighting a fire on property which is under the jurisdiction of the United States. Section 11 requires that certain payments be deducted from those costs and that the Treasury Department will ordinarily pay the amount resulting from the application of that formula. Where the United States has entered into a contract (which is not a mutual aid agreement, defined in § 151.03) for the provision of fire protection, and it is the intent of the parties that reimbursement under section 11 is unavailable, this intent will normally govern. Where a mutual aid agreement is in effect between the claimant and an agency of the United States for the property upon which the fire occurred, reimbursement will be available in otherwise proper situations. However, any payments (including the value of services) rendered under the agreement during the term of the agreement (or the Federal fiscal year in which the fire occurred, if no term is discernible) shall be deducted from the costs claimed, pursuant to § 151.12.

<HEAD>§ 151.12   Determination of amount authorized for payment.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Administrator shall determine the amount to be paid on a claim (subject to payment by the Department of the Treasury). The amount to be paid is the total of eligible expenses, costs and losses under paragraph (a)(1) of this section which exceeds the amount of payments under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The Administrator shall establish the reimbursable amount by determining:
</P>
<P>(1) The extent to which the fire service incurred additional firefighting costs, over and above its normal operating costs, in connection with the fire which is the subject of the claim, i.e., the “amount of costs”; and
</P>
<P>(2) What payments, if any, including taxes or payments in lieu of taxes, the fire service or its parent jurisdiction has received from the United States for the support of fire services on the property on which the fire occurred.
</P>
<FP>The reimbursable amount is the amount, if any, by which the amount of costs, determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section exceeds the amount of payments determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Where more than one claim is filed the aggregate reimbursable amount is the amount by which the total amount of costs, determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section exceed the amount of Federal payments (in the case of a mutual aid agreement—its term or if none is determinable, the Federal fiscal year) determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
</FP>
<P>(b) The Administrator will first determine the costs as contemplated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The Administrator will then notify the claimant as to that amount. The claimant must indicate within 30 days its acceptance or rejection of that amount.
</P>
<P>(1) If the determination is accepted by the claimant, this will be the final and conclusive determination of the amount of costs by the claimant in conjunction with the fire for which the claims are submitted.
</P>
<P>(2) If the claimant rejects this amount, it must notify the Administrator, within 30 days, of its reasons for its rejection. Upon receipt of notification of rejection, the Administrator shall reconsider his determination and notify the claimant of the results of the reconsideration. The amount determined on reconsideration will constitute the costs to be used by the Administrator in determining the reimbursable amount.
</P>
<P>(c) Upon receipt of documentation from the claimant on the amount of payments the Federal Government has made for the support of fire services on the property in question, the Administrator will, following such verification or investigation as the Administrator may deem appropriate, calculate the full amount to be reimbursed under the section 11 formula as set forth in § 151.12(a). This calculation of the reimbursable amount is based upon the costs determined pursuant to § 151.12(b) and the documentation of Federal payments that the claimant submitted.
</P>
<P>(d) The Administrator's determination of the reimbursable amount will be sent to the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury shall, upon receipt of the claim and determination made under § 151.12 (a), (b), and (c), determine the amount authorized for payment, which shall be the amount actually available for payment from any monies in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated but subject to reimbursement (from any appropriations which may be available or which may be made available for the purpose) by the Federal department or agency under whose jurisdiction the fire occurred. This shall be a sum no greater, although it may be less, that the reimbursable amount determined by the Administrator, FEMA, with respect to the claim under § 151.12 (a), (b) and (c).

<HEAD>§ 152.1   Purpose and eligible uses of grant funds.</HEAD>
<P>(a) This competitive grant program will provide funding directly to fire departments of a State for the purpose of enhancing departments abilities to protect the health and safety of the public, as well as that of firefighting personnel, facing fire and fire-related hazards. Eligible applicants can submit only one application per application period. Departments that submit multiple applications in one application period will have each of their applications deemed ineligible. 
</P>
<P>(b) Eligible applicants are fire departments or fire departments of a State which is defined as an agency or organization that has a “formally recognized arrangement” with a State, local or tribal authority (city, county, parish, fire district, township, town, or other non-Federal governing body) to provide fire suppression services within a fixed geographical area. A fire department can apply for assistance for its emergency medical services unit provided the unit falls organizationally under the auspices of the fire department. A municipality or fire district may submit an application on behalf of a fire department when the fire department lacks the legal status to do so, e.g., where the fire department falls within the auspices of the municipality. When a municipality or fire district submits an application on behalf of a fire department, the fire department is precluded from submitting an additional application. Non-Federal airport and/or port authority fire departments are eligible, but only if they have a formally recognized arrangement with the local jurisdiction to provide fire suppression, on a first-due basis, outside the confines of the airport or port facilities. Airport or port authority fire departments whose sole responsibility is suppression of fires on the airport grounds or port facilities are not eligible for this grant program. Fire departments that are Federal or contracted by the Federal government and whose sole responsibility is suppression of fires on Federal installations are not eligible for this grant program. Fire stations that are not independent but are part of, or controlled by a larger fire department or agency, are typically not eligible. Fire departments that are for-profit departments (<I>i.e.,</I> do not have specific non-profit status or are not municipally based) are not eligible to apply for assistance under this program.

</P>
<P><I>Construction</I> is the creation of a new structure or any modification of the footprint or profile of an existing structure. Changes or renovations to an existing structure that do not change the footprint or profile of the structure but exceed either $10,000 or 50 percent of the value of the structure, are also considered construction for the purposes of this grant program. Changes that are less than $10,000 and/or 50 percent of the value of the structure are considered renovations, for the purposes of this grant program. 
</P>
<P><I>Direct delivery of training</I> is training conducted within a training organization's own jurisdiction using the organization's own resources (trainers, facilities, equipment, etc.). 
</P>
<P><I>Fire boat</I> is a vessel designed primarily for firefighting operations, however, may also be capable of water rescue and hazardous materials spills mitigation, etc. These vessels may also have the capability to pump a large volume of water from a drafting operation. 
</P>
<P><I>Fire department or fire department of a State</I> is an agency or organization that has a “formally recognized arrangement” with a State, local or tribal authority (city, county, parish, fire district, township, town, or other non-Federal governing body) to provide fire suppression services within a fixed geographical area. A fire department can apply for assistance for its emergency medical services unit provided the unit falls organizationally under the auspices of the fire department. A municipality or fire district may submit an application on behalf of a fire department when the fire department lacks the legal status to do so, e.g., where the fire department falls within the auspices of the municipality. When a municipality or fire district submits an application on behalf of a fire department, the fire department is precluded from submitting an additional application. Non-Federal airport and/or port authority fire departments are eligible, but only if they have a formally recognized arrangement with the local jurisdiction to provide fire suppression services, on a first-due basis, outside the confines of the airport or port facilities. Airport or port authority fire departments whose sole responsibility is suppression of fires on the airport grounds or port facilities are not eligible for this grant program. Fire departments that are Federal or contracted by the Federal government and whose sole responsibility is suppression of fires on Federal installations are not eligible for this grant program. Fire departments or fire stations that are not independent but are part of, or controlled by a larger fire department or agency, are typically not eligible. Fire departments that are for-profit departments (<I>i.e.,</I> do not have specific non-profit status or are not municipally based) are not eligible to apply for assistance under this program.

</P>
<P><I>Formally recognized arrangement</I> is an agreement between the fire department and a local jurisdiction such that the jurisdiction has publicly or otherwise formally deemed that the fire department has the first-due response responsibilities within a fixed geographical area of the jurisdiction. Often this agreement is recognized or reported to the appropriate State entity with cognizance over fire departments, such as registration with the State Fire Marshal's office, or the agreement is specifically contained in the fire department's or jurisdiction's charter. 
</P>
<P>Integrated communication systems and devices are equipment or systems for dispatch centers or communication infrastructure. Examples of these include 911 systems, computer-aided dispatch systems, global positioning systems, fixed repeaters, etc. Towers are an integral part of any communication system, but they are not eligible to be included in any award under this program. 
</P>
<P><I>New mission</I> is a first-responder function that a department has never delivered in the past or that was once delivered but has since been abandoned by the department due to the lack of funding or community support. Examples include technical search and rescue, emergency medical services, hazardous materials response, etc. A new mission does not include services already provided from existing facilities. Opening additional stations to provide similar services would be considered an expansion of existing services. 
</P>
<P><I>Population</I> means permanent residents in the first-due response area or jurisdiction served by the applicant. It would include students but does not include seasonal population or any population in area that the fire department responds to under mutual/automatic aid agreements.

<HEAD>§ 152.5   Review process and evaluation criteria.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Every application will be evaluated based on the answers to the activity-specific questions during our initial screening. The applications that are determined to best address the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program's established priorities during this initial screening will be in the “competitive range” and subject to a second level of review. We will use the narratives/supplemental information provided by the applicants in their grant applications to evaluate, on a competitive basis, the merits and benefits of each request for funding. In selecting applications for award, we will evaluate each application for assistance independently based on established eligibility criteria and the program priorities. Eligible applicants that best address the priorities will advance to a second level of review. The second level of review involves an assessment of the financial needs of the applicant, and an analysis of the benefits that would result from the grant award. 
</P>
<P>(b) In order to be successful at this second level of the evaluation, an applicant must complete the narrative section of the application package. The narrative should include a detailed description of the planned program, uses for the grant funds including details of each budget line item. For example, if personnel costs are included in the budget, please provide a break down of what those costs are for. The narrative should explain why the grant funds are needed and why the department has not been able to obtain funding for the planned activities on its own. A discussion of financial need should include a discussion of any Federal funding received for similar activities. Finally, the applicant's narrative should detail the benefits the department or community will realize as a result of the grant award. 
</P>
<P>(c) This second level of review will be conducted using a panel of technical evaluation panelists. These panelists are largely made up of non-Federal experts with a fire service background. The panelists will assess the application's merits with respect to the clarity and detail provided in the narrative about the project, the applicant's financial need, and the project's purported benefit to be derived from the cost. Technical evaluation panelists will independently score each application before them and then discuss the merits/shortcomings of the application in an effort to reconcile any major discrepancies. A consensus on the score is not required. The highest scoring applications resulting from this second level of review will then be considered for award. We seek to maximize the benefits derived from the funding by crediting applicants with the greatest financial need and whose proposed activities provide the greatest benefit versus the cost. 
</P>
<P>(d) In addition to the project narrative, the applicant must provide an itemized budget detailing the use of the grant funds. If an applicant is seeking funds in more than one eligible activity within a program, separate budgets will have to be generated for each activity and then an overall or summary budget will have to be generated. For those applicants applying on line, the summary budget will be automatically generated by the e-grants system. 
</P>
<P>(e) Specific rating criteria for each of the eligible programs will be published in a Notice of Funding Availability that we will publish pursuant to the program's annual appropriation.

<HEAD>§ 152.6   Application review and award process.</HEAD>
<P>(a) As stated in § 152.5, we will evaluate each application in the preliminary screening process to determine which applications best address the program's established priorities. The best applications as determined in this preliminary step will be deemed to be in the “competitive range.” All applications in the competitive range will advance to a second level review by a technical evaluation panel. Using the evaluation criteria detailed in the Program Guidance and in the NOFA (both of which are published pursuant to this program's annual appropriation), the panelists will score each application they evaluate. The assigned score will reflect the degree to which the applicant: clearly relates their proposed project; demonstrates financial need; and, details a high benefit to cost value of the proposed activities. We will provide the panelists the complete application content for their evaluation. We will also provide them with reference materials for national standards or regulations and guidelines with respect to typical costs for proposed apparatus and equipment purchases. 
</P>
<P>(b) Our award decisions will be based on the stated priorities of the grant program first, then on the demonstrated need of the applicant and the benefits to be derived from the proposed projects. We will make awards on a competitive basis, <I>i.e.,</I> we will fund the highest scored applications before considering lower scored applications. 
</P>
<P>(c) In a few cases, to fulfill our obligations under the law to make grants to a variety of departments, we may also make funding decisions using rank order as the preliminary basis, and then analyze the type of fire department (paid, volunteer, or combination fire departments), the size and character of the community it serves (urban, suburban, or rural), and/or the geographic location of the fire department. In these instances where we are making decisions based on geographic location, we will use States as the basic geographic unit. We may also base our funding decisions on previous grant awards funded by this program and/or grantees' performance on previous grants and a technical evaluation of reasonable costs for labor, services, materials or equipment.

<HEAD>§ 152.7   Grant payment, reporting and other requirements.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Grantees will have twelve months to incur obligations and complete the scope of work to fulfill their responsibilities under this grant program. The performance period of each grant will be detailed in the Articles of Agreement that we provide each grantee. Grantees may request funds from FEMA as reimbursement for expenditures made under the grant program or they may request funds for immediate cash needs under 2 CFR 200.305. Advances of funds may also be approved to meet immediate cash needs. 
</P>
<P>(b) Generally, fire departments cannot use grant funds to pay for products and services contracted for, or purchased prior to the effective date of the grant. However, we will consider requests for reimbursement for these on an exception basis. Expenses incurred after the application deadline but prior to award may be eligible for reimbursement if the expenses were justified, unavoidable (i.e., urgent and compelling), consistent with the scope of work, and specifically approved by the Assistance Officer. Expenses, obligations, commitments or contracts incurred or entered into prior to the application deadline are not eligible to be included as an expense. 
</P>
<P>(c) All grantees must follow their own established procurement process when buying anything with Federal grant funds as provided in 2 CFR 200.317-200.326. If the grantee does not have an established procurement process, they must seek a minimum of two bids for any acquisition. 
</P>
<P>(d) When requesting funding, grantees can only request an amount that is necessary to satisfy their immediate cash needs directly related to the grant, i.e., an amount equal to the total eligible grant expenses due within 30 days. Grantees can request payments of up to one hundred (100) percent of the federal share of the award amount but only if delivery of the ordered products and/or services is imminent (approximately 30 days) and the resulting payment will require the entire amount of funds. 
</P>
<P>(e) A grantee may request sufficient funding for a down payment if required to do so by the seller, such as in grants involving some purchases of firefighting vehicles. The grantee may request as much as fifty (50) percent of the federal share of the award amount at the time of the order placement to pay the down payment. The grantee may request the balance of the federal share upon delivery of the ordered equipment or vehicle. 
</P>
<P>(f) The recipients of funding under this program must report to us on how the grant funding was used and the benefits that resulted. This will be accomplished via submission of performance reports. Details regarding the reporting requirements will be provided in the Articles of Agreement provided to each grantee. 
</P>
<P>(g) Fire departments that receive funding under this program must agree to provide information to the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) for the period covered by the assistance. If a grantee does not currently participate in the incident reporting system and does not have the capacity to report at the time of the award, that grantee must agree to provide information to the system for a twelve-month period commencing as soon as possible after they develop the capacity to report. Capacity to report to the NFIRS must be established prior to the termination of the one-year performance period.

Essential assistance activities that may be eligible include, but are not limited to, police barricading and traffic control, extraordinary emergency operations center expenses, evacuations and sheltering, search and rescue, arson investigation teams, public information, and the limited removal of trees that pose a threat to the general public. 
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Temporary repair of damage caused by firefighting activities.</I> Temporary repair of damage caused by eligible firefighting activities listed in this subpart involves short-term actions to repair damage directly caused by the firefighting effort or activities. This includes minimal repairs to bulldozer lines, camps, and staging areas to address safety concerns; as well as minimal repairs to facilities damaged by the firefighting activities such as fences, buildings, bridges, roads, etc. All temporary repair work must be completed within thirty days of the close of the incident period for the declared fire. 
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Mobilization and demobilization.</I> Costs for mobilization to, and demobilization from, a declared fire may be eligible for reimbursement. Demobilization may be claimed at a delayed date if deployment involved one or more declared fires. If resources are being used on more than one declared fire, mobilization and demobilization costs must be claimed against the first declared fire. 
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Fires on co-mingled Federal/State lands.</I> Reasonable costs for the mitigation, management, and control of a declared fire burning on co-mingled Federal and State land may be eligible in cases where the State has a responsibility for suppression activities under an agreement to perform such action on a non-reimbursable basis. (This provision is an exception to normal FEMA policy under the Stafford Act and is intended to accommodate only those rare instances that involve State firefighting on a Stafford Act section 420 fire incident involving co-mingled Federal/State and privately-owned forest or grassland.)

<P>(a) <I>Duplication of benefits.</I> FEMA provides supplementary assistance under the Stafford Act, which generally may not duplicate benefits received by or available to the applicant from insurance, other assistance programs, legal awards, or any other source to address the same purpose. An applicant must notify FEMA of all benefits that it receives or anticipates from other sources for the same purpose, and must seek all such benefits available to them. FEMA will reduce the grant by the amounts available for the same purpose from another source.

<P>(c) <I>Negligence.</I> FEMA will provide no assistance to an applicant for costs attributable to applicant's own negligence. If the applicant suspects negligence by a third party for causing a condition for which FEMA made assistance available under this Part, the applicant is responsible for taking all reasonable steps to recover all costs attributable to the negligence of the third party. FEMA generally considers such amounts to be duplicated benefits available to the recipient or subrecipient, and will treat them consistent with (a) of this section.

<P>(d) <I>Intentional acts.</I> Any person who intentionally causes a condition for which assistance is provided under this part shall be liable to the United States to the extent that FEMA incurs costs attributable to the intentional act or omission that caused the condition. FEMA may provide assistance under this part, but it will be conditioned on an agreement by the applicant to cooperate with FEMA in efforts to recover the cost of the assistance from the liable party.

<HEAD>§ 206.33   Preliminary damage assessment.</HEAD>
<P>The preliminary damage assessment (PDA) process is a mechanism used to determine the impact and magnitude of damage and the resulting unmet needs of individuals, businesses, the public sector, and the community as a whole. Information collected is used by the State as a basis for the Governor's request, and by FEMA to document the recommendation made to the President in response to the Governor's request. It is in the best interest of all parties to combine State and Federal personnel resources by performing a joint PDA prior to the initiation of a Governor's request, as follows.
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Preassessment by the State.</I> When an incident occurs, or is imminent, which the State official responsible for disaster operations determines may be beyond the State and local government capabilities to respond, the State will request the Regional Administrator to perform a joint FEMA-State preliminary damage assessment. It is not anticipated that all occurrences will result in the requirement for assistance; therefore, the State will be expected to verify their initial information, in some manner, before requesting this support.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Damage assessment teams.</I> Damage assessment teams will be composed of at least one representative of the Federal Government and one representative of the State. A local government representative, familiar with the extent and location of damage in his/her community, should also be included, if possible. Other State and Federal agencies, and voluntary relief organizations may also be asked to participate, as needed. It is the State's responsibility to coordinate State and local participation in the PDA and to ensure that the participants receive timely notification concerning the schedule. A FEMA official will brief team members on damage criteria, the kind of information to be collected for the particular incident, and reporting requirements.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Review of findings.</I> At the close of the PDA, FEMA will consult with State officials to discuss findings and reconcile any differences.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Exceptions.</I> The requirement for a joint PDA may be waived for those incidents of unusual severity and magnitude that do not require field damage assessments to determine the need for supplemental Federal assistance under the Act, or in such other instances determined by the Regional Administrator upon consultation with the State. It may be necessary, however, to conduct an assessment to determine unmet needs for managerial response purposes.

<HEAD>§ 206.35   Requests for emergency declarations.</HEAD>
<P>(a) When an incident occurs or threatens to occur in a State, which would not qualify under the definition of a major disaster, the Governor of a State, or the Acting Governor in his/her absence, may request that the President declare an emergency. The Governor should submit the request to the President through the appropriate Regional Administrator to ensure prompt acknowledgment and processing. The request must be submitted within 5 days after the need for assistance under title V becomes apparent, but no longer than 30 days after the occurrence of the incident, in order to be considered. The period may be extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate provided that a written request for such extension is made by the Governor, or Acting Governor, during the 30-day period immediately following the incident. The extension request must stipulate the reason for the delay.
</P>
<P>(b) The basis for the Governor's request must be the finding that the situation:
</P>
<P>(1) Is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capability of the State and the affected local government(s); and
</P>
<P>(2) Requires supplementary Federal emergency assistance to save lives and to protect property, public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a disaster.
</P>
<P>(c) In addition to the above findings, the complete request shall include:
</P>
<P>(1) Confirmation that the Governor has taken appropriate action under State law and directed the execution of the State emergency plan;
</P>
<P>(2) Information describing the State and local efforts and resources which have been or will be used to alleviate the emergency;
</P>
<P>(3) Information describing other Federal agency efforts and resources which have been or will be used in responding to this incident; and
</P>
<P>(4) Identification of the type and extent of additional Federal aid required.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Modified declaration for Federal emergencies.</I> The requirement for a Governor's request under paragraph (a) of this section can be waived when an emergency exists for which the primary responsibility rests in the Federal government because the emergency involves a subject area for which, under the Constitution or laws of the United States, the Federal government exercises exclusive or preeminent responsibility and authority. Any party may bring the existence of such a situation to the attention of the FEMA Regional Administrator. Any recommendation for a Presidential declaration of emergency in the absence of a Governor's request must be initiated by the Regional Administrator or transmitted through the Regional Administrator by another Federal agency. In determining that such an emergency exists, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or Regional Administrator shall consult the Governor of the affected State, if practicable.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Other authorities.</I> It is not intended for an emergency declaration to preempt other Federal agency authorities and/or established plans and response mechanisms in place prior to the enactment of the Stafford Act.

The request must be submitted within 30 days of the occurrence of the incident in order to be considered. The 30-day period may be extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, provided that a written request for an extension is submitted by the Governor, or Acting Governor, during this 30-day period. The extension request will stipulate reasons for the delay.
</P>
<P>(b) The basis for the request shall be a finding that:
</P>
<P>(1) The situation is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments; and
</P>
<P>(2) Federal assistance under the Act is necessary to supplement the efforts and available resources of the State, local governments, disaster relief organizations, and compensation by insurance for disaster-related losses.
</P>
<P>(c) In addition to the above findings, the complete request shall include:
</P>
<P>(1) Confirmation that the Governor has taken appropriate action under State law and directed the execution of the State emergency plan;
</P>
<P>(2) An estimate of the amount and severity of damages and losses stating the impact of the disaster on the public and private sector;

</P>
<P>(5) Certification by the Governor that State and local government obligations and expenditures for the current disaster will comply with all applicable cost sharing requirements of the Stafford Act.
</P>
<P>(d) For those catastrophes of unusual severity and magnitude when field damage assessments are not necessary to determine the requirement for supplemental Federal assistance, the Governor or Acting Governor may send an abbreviated written request through the Regional Administrator for a declaration of a major disaster. This may be transmitted in the most expeditious manner available. In the event the FEMA Regional Office is severely impacted by the catastrophe, the request may be addressed to the Administrator of FEMA. The request must indicate a finding in accordance with § 206.36(b), and must include as a minimum the information requested by § 206.36 (c)(1), (c)(3), and (c)(5). Upon receipt of the request, FEMA shall expedite the processing of reports and recommendations to the President. Notification to the Governor of the Presidential declaration shall be in accordance with 44 CFR 206.39. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorateshall assure that documentation of the declaration is later assembled to comply fully with these regulations.

The data will be analyzed and submitted with a recommendation to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Regional Analysis shall include a discussion of State and local resources and capabilities, and other assistance available to meet the major disaster or emergency-related needs.

<P>(c) <I>FEMA recommendation.</I> Based on all available information, the Administrator shall formulate a recommendation which shall be forwarded to the President with the Governor's request.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Major disaster recommendation.</I> The recommendation will be based on a finding that the situation is or is not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the State and its local governments. It will also contain a determination of whether or not supplemental Federal assistance under the Stafford Act is necessary and appropriate. In developing a recommendation, FEMA will consider such factors as the amount and type of damages; the impact of damages on affected individuals, the State, and local governments; the available resources of the State and local governments, and other disaster relief organizations; the extent and type of insurance in effect to cover losses; assistance available from other Federal programs and other sources; imminent threats to public health and safety; recent disaster history in the State; hazard mitigation measures taken by the State or local governments, especially implementation of measures required as a result of previous major disaster declarations; and other factors pertinent to a given incident.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Emergency recommendation.</I> The recommendation will be based on a report which will indicate whether or not Federal emergency assistance under section 502 of the Stafford Act is necessary to supplement State and local efforts to save lives, protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe. Only after it has been determined that all other resources and authorities available to meet the crisis are inadequate, and that assistance provided in section 502 of the Stafford Act would be appropriate, will FEMA recommend an emergency declaration to the President.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Modified Federal emergency recommendation.</I> The recommendation will be based on a report which will indicate that an emergency does or does not exist for which assistance under section 502 of the Stafford Act would be appropriate. An emergency declaration will not be recommended in situations where the authority to respond or coordinate is within the jurisdiction of one or more Federal agencies without a Presidential declaration. However, where there are significant unmet needs of sufficient severity and magnitude, not addressed by other assistance, which could appropriately be addressed under the Stafford Act, the involvement of other Federal agencies would not preclude a declaration of an emergency under the Act.

<HEAD>§ 206.48   Factors considered when evaluating a Governor's request for a major disaster declaration.</HEAD>
<P>When we review a Governor's request for major disaster assistance under the Stafford Act, these are the primary factors in making a recommendation to the President whether assistance is warranted. We consider other relevant information as well.
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Public Assistance Program.</I> We evaluate the following factors to evaluate the need for assistance under the Public Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Estimated cost of the assistance.</I> We evaluate the estimated cost of Federal and nonfederal public assistance against the statewide population to give some measure of the per capita impact within the State. We use a figure of $1 per capita as an indicator that the disaster is of such size that it might warrant Federal assistance, and adjust this figure annually based on the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers. We are establishing a minimum threshold of $1 million in public assistance damages per disaster in the belief that we can reasonably expect even the lowest population States to cover this level of public assistance damage.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Localized impacts.</I> We evaluate the impact of the disaster at the county and local government level, as well as impacts at the American Indian and Alaskan Native Tribal Government levels, because at times there are extraordinary concentrations of damages that might warrant Federal assistance even if the statewide per capita is not met. This is particularly true where critical facilities are involved or where localized per capita impacts might be extremely high. For example, we have at times seen localized damages in the tens or even hundreds of dollars per capita though the statewide per capita impact was low.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Insurance coverage in force.</I> We consider the amount of insurance coverage that is in force or should have been in force as required by law and regulation at the time of the disaster, and reduce the amount of anticipated assistance by that amount.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Hazard mitigation.</I> To recognize and encourage mitigation, we consider the extent to which State and local government measures contributed to the reduction of disaster damages for the disaster under consideration. For example, if a State can demonstrate in its disaster request that a Statewide building code or other mitigation measures are likely to have reduced the damages from a particular disaster, we consider that in the evaluation of the request. This could be especially significant in those disasters where, because of mitigation, the estimated public assistance damages fell below the per capita indicator.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Recent multiple disasters.</I> We look at the disaster history within the last twelve-month period to evaluate better the overall impact on the State or locality. We consider declarations under the Stafford Act as well as declarations by the Governor and the extent to which the State has spent its own funds.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Programs of other Federal assistance.</I> We also consider programs of other Federal agencies because at times their programs of assistance might more appropriately meet the needs created by the disaster.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Factors for the Individual Assistance Program.</I> The following factors are used to evaluate the need for supplemental Federal assistance to individuals under the Stafford Act, as Federal assistance may not supplant the combined capabilities of a State, Tribal, or local government. Federal Individual Assistance, if authorized, is intended to assist eligible individuals and families when State, Tribal, and local government resources and assistance programs are overwhelmed. State fiscal capacity (44 CFR 206.48(b)(1)(i)) and uninsured home and personal property losses (44 CFR 206.48(b)(2)) are the principal factors that FEMA will consider when evaluating the need for supplemental Federal assistance under the Individuals and Households Program but FEMA will always consider all relevant information submitted as part of a declaration request. If the need for supplemental Federal assistance under the Individuals and Households Program is not clear from the evaluation of the principal factors, FEMA will turn to the other factors to determine the level of need.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>State fiscal capacity and resource availability.</I> FEMA will evaluate the availability of State resources, and where appropriate, any extraordinary circumstances that contributed to the absence of sufficient resources.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Fiscal capacity (principal factor for individuals and households program).</I> Fiscal capacity is a State's potential ability to raise revenue from its own sources to respond to and recover from a disaster. The following data points are indicators of fiscal capacity.
</P>
<P>(A) <I>Total taxable resources (TTR) of the State.</I> TTR is the U.S. Department of Treasury's annual estimate of the relative fiscal capacity of a State. A low TTR may indicate a greater need for supplemental Federal assistance than a high TTR.
</P>
<P>(B) <I>Gross domestic product (GDP) by State.</I> GDP by State is calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. GDP by State may be used as an alternative or supplemental evaluation method to TTR.
</P>
<P>(C) <I>Per capita personal income by local area.</I> Per capita personal income by local area is calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. A low per capita personal income by local area may indicate a greater need for supplemental Federal assistance than a high per capita personal income by local area.
</P>
<P>(D) <I>Other factors.</I> Other limits on a State's treasury or ability to collect funds may be considered.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Resource availability.</I> Federal disaster assistance under the Stafford Act is intended to be supplemental in nature, and is not a replacement for State emergency relief programs, services, and funds. FEMA evaluates the availability of resources from State, Tribal, and local governments as well as non-governmental organizations and the private sector.
</P>
<P>(A) <I>State, tribal, and local government; non-governmental organizations (NGO); and Private Sector Activity.</I> State, Tribal, and local government, Non-Governmental Organizations, and private sector resources may offset the need for or reveal an increased need for supplemental Federal assistance. The State may provide information regarding the resources that have been and will be committed to meet the needs of disaster survivors such as housing programs, resources provided through financial and in-kind donations, and the availability of affordable (as determined by the U.S. Department of Urban and Housing Development's fair market rent standards) rental housing within a reasonable commuting distance of the impacted area.
</P>
<P>(B) <I>Cumulative effect of recent disasters.</I> The cumulative effect of recent disasters may affect the availability of State, Tribal, local government, NGO, and private sector disaster recovery resources. The State should provide information regarding the disaster history within the last 24-month period, particularly those occurring within the current fiscal cycle, including both Presidential (public and individual assistance) and gubernatorial disaster declarations.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Uninsured home and personal property losses (principal factor for individuals and households program).</I> Uninsured home and personal property losses may suggest a need for supplemental Federal assistance. The State may provide the following preliminary damage assessment data:
</P>
<P>(i) The cause of damage.
</P>
<P>(ii) The jurisdictions impacted and concentration of damage.
</P>
<P>(iii) The number of homes impacted and degree of damage.
</P>
<P>(iv) The estimated cost of assistance.
</P>
<P>(v) The homeownership rate of impacted homes.
</P>
<P>(vi) The percentage of affected households with sufficient insurance coverage appropriate to the peril.
</P>
<P>(vii) Other relevant preliminary damage assessment data.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Disaster impacted population profile.</I> The demographics of a disaster impacted population may identify additional needs that require a more robust community response and delay a community's ability to recover from a disaster. FEMA will consider demographics of the impacted communities for the following data points as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau or other Federal agencies:
</P>
<P>(i) The percentage of the population for whom poverty status is determined.
</P>
<P>(ii) The percentage of the population already receiving government assistance such as Supplemental Security Income and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.
</P>
<P>(iii) The pre-disaster unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>(iv) The percentage of the population that is 65 years old and older.
</P>
<P>(v) The percentage of the population 18 years old and younger.
</P>
<P>(vi) The percentage of the population with a disability.
</P>
<P>(vii) The percentage of the population who speak a language other than English and speak English less than “very well.”
</P>
<P>(viii) Any unique considerations regarding American Indian and Alaskan Native Tribal populations raised in the State's request for a major disaster declaration that may not be reflected in the data points referenced in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (vii) of this section.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Impact to community infrastructure.</I> The following impacts to a community's infrastructure may adversely affect a population's ability to safely and securely reside within the community.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Life saving and life sustaining services.</I> The effects of a disaster may cause disruptions to or increase the demand for life-saving and life-sustaining services, necessitate a more robust response, and may delay a community's ability to recover from a disaster. The State may provide information regarding the impact on life saving and life sustaining services for a period of greater than 72 hours. Such services include but are not limited to police, fire/EMS, hospital/medical, sewage, and water treatment services.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Essential community services.</I> The effects of a disaster may cause disruptions to or increase the demand for essential community services and delay a community's ability to recover from a disaster. The State may provide information regarding the impact on essential community services for a period greater than 72 hours. Such services include but are not limited to schools, social services programs and providers, child care, and eldercare.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Transportation infrastructure and utilities.</I> Transportation infrastructure or utility disruptions may render housing uninhabitable or inaccessible. Such conditions may also affect the delivery of life sustaining commodities, provision of emergency services, ability to shelter in place, and efforts to rebuild. The State may provide information regarding the impact on transportation infrastructure and utilities for a period of greater than 72 hours.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Casualties.</I> The number of individuals who are missing, injured, or deceased due to a disaster may indicate a heightened need for supplemental Federal disaster assistance. The State may report the number of missing, injured, or deceased individuals.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Disaster related unemployment.</I> The number of disaster survivors who lost work or became unemployed due to a disaster and who do not qualify for standard unemployment insurance may indicate a heightened need for supplemental Federal assistance. This usually includes the self-employed, service industry workers, and seasonal workers such as those employed in tourism, fishing, or agriculture industries. The State may provide an estimate of the number of disaster survivors impacted under this paragraph as well as information regarding major employers affected.

<HEAD>§ 206.110   Federal assistance to individuals and households.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Purpose.</I> This section implements the policy and procedures set forth in the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (Stafford Act), 42 U.S.C. 5174. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174, as amended by the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. This program provides financial assistance and, if necessary, direct assistance to eligible individuals and households who, as a direct result of a major disaster or emergency, have uninsured or under-insured, necessary expenses and serious needs and are unable to meet such expenses or needs through other means. 
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Maximum amount of assistance.</I> No individual or household will receive financial assistance greater than $25,000 under this subpart with respect to a single major disaster or emergency for the repair or replacement of their pre-disaster primary residence. No individual or household will receive financial assistance greater than $25,000 under this subpart with respect to a single major disaster or emergency for Other Needs Assistance. FEMA will adjust the $25,000 limits annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers that the Department of Labor publishes.
</P>
<P>(1) The maximum amount of financial assistance excludes rental assistance under § 206.117(b)(1)(i) and lodging expense reimbursement under § 206.117(b)(1)(i).
</P>
<P>(2) The maximum amount of financial assistance excludes expenses to repair or replace eligible damaged accessibility-related real property improvements and personal property for individuals with disabilities.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Multiple types of assistance.</I> One or more types of housing assistance may be made available under this section to meet the needs of individuals and households in the particular disaster situation. FEMA will determine the appropriate types of housing assistance to be provided under this section based on considerations of cost effectiveness, convenience to the individuals and households and the suitability and availability of the types of assistance. An applicant is expected to accept the first offer of housing assistance; unwarranted refusal of assistance may result in the forfeiture of future housing assistance. Temporary housing and repair assistance must be utilized to the fullest extent practicable before other types of housing assistance.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Date of eligibility.</I> Eligibility for Federal assistance under this subpart is limited to losses or expenses resulting from damage that occurred during the dates of the incident period established in a presidential declaration that a major disaster or emergency exists, except that reasonable lodging expenses that are incurred in anticipation of and immediately preceding such event may be eligible for Federal assistance under this chapter.

 
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Period of assistance.</I> FEMA may provide assistance under this subpart for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date of declaration. The Assistant Administrator for the Recovery Directorate may extend the period of assistance if he/she determines that due to extraordinary circumstances an extension would be in the public interest.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Assistance not counted as income.</I> Assistance under this subpart is not to be counted as income or a resource in the determination of eligibility for welfare, income assistance or income-tested benefit programs that the Federal Government funds. 
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Exemption from garnishment.</I> All assistance provided under this subpart is exempt from garnishment, seizure, encumbrance, levy, execution, pledge, attachment, release or waiver. Recipients of rights under this provision may not reassign or transfer the rights. These exemptions do not apply to FEMA recovering assistance fraudulently obtained or misapplied. 
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Duplication of benefits.</I> In accordance with the requirements of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5155, FEMA will not provide assistance under this subpart when any other source has already provided such assistance or when such assistance is available from any other source. In the instance of insured applicants, we will provide assistance under this subpart only when:
</P>
<P>(1) Payment of the applicable benefits are significantly delayed; 
</P>
<P>(2) Applicable benefits are insufficient to cover the housing or other needs; or 


</P>
<P>(3) Applicants cannot use their insurance because there is no housing on the private market.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Cost sharing.</I> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, the Federal share of eligible costs paid under this subpart is 100 percent.
</P>
<P>(2) Federal and State cost shares for “Other Needs” assistance under the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174(e) and (f), are as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) The Federal share is 75 percent; and
</P>
<P>(ii) The non-Federal share is 25 percent and must be paid from funds made available by the State. If the State does not provide the non-Federal share to FEMA before FEMA begins to provide assistance to individuals and households under the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174(e), FEMA will still process applications. The State will then be obliged to reimburse FEMA for the non-Federal cost share of such assistance on a monthly basis. If the State does not provide such reimbursement on a monthly basis, then FEMA will issue a billing notice to the State on a monthly basis for the duration of the program. FEMA will charge interest, penalties, and administrative costs on delinquent billing notices in accordance with the Debt Collection Improvement Act. Cost shared funds, interest, penalties and administrative costs owed to FEMA through delinquent billing notices may be offset from other FEMA disaster assistance programs (<I>i.e.,</I> Public Assistance) from which the State is receiving assistance, or future grant awards from FEMA or other Federal Agencies. Debt Collection procedures will be followed as outlined in 44 CFR part 11.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Application of the Privacy Act.</I> (1) All provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, apply to this subpart. FEMA may not disclose an applicant's record except: 
</P>
<P>(i) In response to a release signed by the applicant that specifies the purpose for the release, to whom the release is to be made, and that the applicant authorizes the release; 
</P>
<P>(ii) In accordance with one of the published routine uses in our system of records; or 
</P>
<P>(iii) As provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section. 
</P>
<P>(2) Under the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174(f)(2), FEMA must share applicant information with States in order for the States to make available any additional State and local disaster assistance to individuals and households.
</P>
<P>(i) States receiving applicant information under this paragraph must protect such information in the same manner that the Privacy Act requires FEMA to protect it. 


</P>
<P>(ii) States receiving such applicant information must not further disclose the information to other entities, and must not use it for purposes other than providing additional State or local disaster assistance to individuals and households.
</P>
<P>(k) <I>Flood Disaster Protection Act requirement.</I> (1) The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, Public Law 93-234, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4106), imposes certain restrictions on federal financial assistance for acquisition and construction purposes. For the purpose of this paragraph, <I>financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes</I> means assistance to an individual or household to buy, receive, build, repair or improve insurable portions of a home and/or to purchase or repair insurable contents. For a discussion of what elements of a home and contents are insurable, <I>See</I> 44 CFR part 61, Insurance Coverage and Rates. 
</P>
<P>(2) Individuals or households that are located in a special flood hazard area may not receive Federal Assistance for National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)—insurable real and/or personal property, damaged by a flood, unless the community in which the property is located is participating in the NFIP (See 44 CFR 59.1), or the exception in 42 U.S.C. 4105(d) applies. However, if the community in which the damaged property is located qualifies for and enters the NFIP during the six-month period following the declaration, the Governor's Authorized Representative may request a time extension for FEMA (<I>See</I> § 206.112) to accept registrations and to process assistance applications in that community. 
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Flood insurance purchase requirement:</I> (i) As a condition of the assistance and in order to receive any Federal assistance for future flood damage to any insurable property, individuals and households named by FEMA as eligible recipients under the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174, who receive assistance, due to flood damage, for acquisition or construction purposes under this subpart must buy and maintain flood insurance, as required in 42 U.S.C. 4012a, for at least the assistance amount. This applies only to real and personal property that is in or will be in a designated Special Flood Hazard Area and that can be insured under the National Flood Insurance Program. 
</P>
<P>(A) If the applicant is a homeowner, flood insurance coverage must be maintained at the address of the flood-damaged property for as long as there is a residential building (See 44 CFR 59.1) at the address. The flood insurance requirement is reassigned to any subsequent owner of the flood-damaged address. 
</P>
<P>(B) If the applicant is a renter, flood insurance coverage must be maintained on the contents for as long as the renter resides at the flood-damaged rental unit. The restriction is lifted once the renter moves from the rental unit. 
</P>
<P>(C) When financial assistance is used to purchase a dwelling, flood insurance coverage must be maintained on the dwelling for as long as the dwelling exists and is located in a designated Special Flood Hazard Area. The flood insurance requirement is reassigned to any subsequent owner of the dwelling. 
</P>
<P>(ii) FEMA may not provide financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes to individuals or households who fail to buy and maintain flood insurance required under paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this section or required by the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>(l) <I>Environmental requirements.</I> Assistance provided under this subpart must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other environmental laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and applicable agency policy.


</P>
<P>(m) <I>Historic preservation.</I> Assistance provided under this subpart generally does not have the potential to affect historic properties and thus FEMA has no further obligations under the National Historic Preservation Act, 54 U.S.C. 306108, with the exception of ground disturbing activities and construction related to §§ 206.117(b)(1)(ii) (direct housing), 206.117(b)(2)(ii)(F) (repair assistance for privately owned roads and bridges), 206.117(b)(3) (replacement assistance), and 206.117(b)(4) (permanent housing construction).
</P>
<P>(n) <I>Severability.</I> Any provision of this subpart held to be invalid or unenforceable as applied to any person or circumstance should be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect to the provision permitted by law, including as applied to persons not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances, unless such holding is that the provision of this subpart is invalid and unenforceable in all circumstances, in which event the provision should be severable from the remainder of this subpart and should not affect the remainder thereof.

</P>
<P>(b) <I>Types of housing assistance</I>—(1) <I>Temporary housing assistance</I>—(i) <I>Rental assistance.</I> Eligible displaced applicants may receive rental assistance to rent alternate housing resources. FEMA may also provide assistance for the reasonable cost of any transportation, utility hookups, or installation of a manufactured housing unit or recreational vehicle to be used for housing. This may include lodging expense reimbursement for reasonable short-term lodging expenses for individuals or households who have not received displacement assistance (See § 206.119(b)(2)) in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. 
</P>
<P>(A) FEMA will include all members of a pre-disaster household in a single registration and will provide assistance for one temporary housing residence, unless FEMA determines that the size or nature of the household requires that we provide assistance for more than one residence.
</P>
<P>(B) FEMA will base the amount of assistance on the current fair market rent for existing rental units. FEMA will further base the applicable rate on the location of the rental unit and the number of bedrooms the household requires, as determined by FEMA.
</P>
<P>(C) Rental assistance may include the payment of the cost of utilities, excluding telephone, cable, television, and internet service.
</P>
<P>(D) Rental assistance may include the payment of the cost of security deposits, not to exceed an amount equal to the fair market rent for one month, as determined under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

</P>
<P>(C) Any site upon which a FEMA-provided temporary housing unit is placed must comply with applicable State and local codes and ordinances, as well as 44 CFR part 9, Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands, and all other applicable environmental and historic preservation laws, regulations, Executive orders, and agency policy.
</P>
<P>(D) All utility costs and utility security deposits are the responsibility of the occupant except where the utility does not meter utility services separately and utility services are a part of the rental charge.
</P>
<P>(E) FEMA-provided or funded temporary housing units may be placed in the following locations:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) A commercial site that is complete with utilities, when FEMA determines that the upgrading of commercial sites, or installation of utilities on such sites, will provide more cost-effective, timely and suitable temporary housing than other types of resources.
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) A private site that an applicant provides, complete with utilities, when FEMA determines that the cost of installation or repairs of essential utilities on private sites will provide more cost effective, timely, and suitable temporary housing than other types of resources.
</P>

</P>
<P>(<I>4</I>) A group site provided by FEMA, if determined that such a site would be more economical or accessible than one that the State or local government provides.
</P>
<P>(F) If FEMA determines it would be a cost-effective alternative to other temporary housing options, FEMA may enter into lease agreements with owners of multifamily rental housing properties to house displaced applicants eligible for assistance under this subpart.
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) FEMA may only enter into lease agreements with owners of multifamily rental housing properties impacted by a major disaster or located in areas covered by a major disaster declaration.
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) FEMA may make repairs or improvements to properties under such lease agreements, to the extent necessary to serve as temporary housing, provided, however, that the value of the improvements or repairs must be deducted from the value of the lease agreement.
</P>
<P>(G) After the end of the 18-month period of assistance, FEMA may begin to charge up to the fair market rent for each temporary housing unit provided. We will base the rent charged on the number of bedrooms occupied and needed by the household. When establishing the amount of rent, FEMA will take into account the financial ability of the household. 
</P>
<P>(H) We may terminate direct assistance for reasons that include, but are not limited to, the following: 
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) The period of assistance expired under § 206.110(e) and has not been extended; 
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) Adequate alternate housing is available to the occupant(s); 
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) The occupant(s) obtained housing assistance through either misrepresentation or fraud; 
</P>
<P>(<I>4</I>) The occupant(s) failed to comply with any term of the lease/rental agreement or other rules of the site where the temporary housing unit is located; or
</P>
<P>(<I>5</I>) The occupant(s) does not provide evidence documenting that they are working towards a permanent housing plan. 
</P>
<P>(I) FEMA will provide a 15 day written notice when initiating the termination of direct assistance that we provide under our lease agreements. This notice will specify the reasons for termination of assistance and occupancy, the date of termination, the procedure for appealing the determination, and the occupant's liability for such additional charges as FEMA deems appropriate after the termination date, including fair market rent for the unit.
</P>
<P>(J) Duplication of benefits may occur when an applicant has additional living expense insurance benefits to cover the cost of renting alternate housing. In these instances, FEMA may provide a temporary housing unit if adequate alternate housing is not available, or if doing so is in the best interest of the household and the government. We will establish fair market rent, not to exceed insurance benefits available. 
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Repairs.</I> (i) FEMA may provide financial assistance for the repair of an owner-occupied primary residence if:
</P>
<P>(A) The eligibility criteria in § 206.113 are met;

In some instances, when the extent of the damage is unclear, FEMA may provide assistance for the average cost of a licensed technician's professional assessment. FEMA may provide for the replacement of a component if repair is not feasible.
</P>
<P>(iv) Eligible individuals or households may receive up to the maximum amount of assistance (See § 206.110(b)) to repair damage to their primary residence irrespective of other financial resources, except insurance proceeds.
</P>
<P>(v) The individual or household is responsible for obtaining all local permits or inspections that applicable State or local building codes may require.

</P>
<P>(iii) Housing replacement assistance will be based on the average replacement cost established by FEMA for the type of residence destroyed, or the statutory maximum (See § 206.110(b)), whichever is less.
</P>
<P>(iv) If the applicant disputes a determination made by FEMA regarding eligibility for replacement assistance, the applicant may appeal that determination pursuant to the procedures in § 206.115. In addition to the requirements in § 206.115, the applicant must provide proof that repair is not feasible, or will not ensure the safety or health of the occupant.

FEMA will adjust the amount of this assistance to reflect changes in the CPI for all Urban Consumers that the Department of Labor publishes.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Displacement.</I> Necessary expenses to assist displaced applicants with short-term living arrangements immediately following a disaster. Applicants must have registered within the 60-day or extended registration period.

</P>
<P>(v) Costs for prescription medicines related to eligible medical or dental services, or which need to be replaced due to the disaster.
</P>

</P>
<P>(i) Standard child care service fees, including personal assistance services that support activities of daily living for children with disabilities; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Registration and health inventory fees for applicants who require a new child care provider.

</P>
<P>(i) Funeral services;
</P>
<P>(ii) Burial or cremation; and

</P>
<P>(ii) Storage of personal property while disaster-related repairs are being made to the primary residence; and
</P>
<P>(iii) Return of the personal property to the individual or household's primary residence.
</P>
<P>(9) <I>Group Flood Insurance purchase.</I> Individuals identified by FEMA as eligible for assistance for flood insurable damage under the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174, as a result of flood damage caused by a Presidentially-declared major disaster and who reside in a special flood hazard area (SFHA) may be included in a Group Flood Insurance Policy (GFIP) established under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations at 44 CFR 61.17.
</P>
<P>(i) The premium for the GFIP is a necessary expense within the meaning of this section. FEMA or the State must withhold this portion of the Other Needs award and provide it to the NFIP on behalf of individuals and households who are eligible for coverage. The coverage must be equivalent to the maximum assistance amount established under the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174.
</P>
<P>(ii) FEMA or the State IHP staff must provide the NFIP with records of individuals who received assistance for flood-insurable losses within a SFHA and are to be insured through the GFIP. Records of applicants to be insured must be accompanied by payments to cover the premium amounts for each applicant for the 3-year policy term. The NFIP will then issue a Certificate of Flood Insurance to each applicant. Flood insurance coverage becomes effective on the 30th day following the receipt of records of GFIP insureds and their premium payments from the State or FEMA, and such coverage terminates 36 months from the inception date of the GFIP, which is 60 days from the date of the disaster declaration.
</P>
<P>(iii) Insured applicants would not be covered if they are determined to be ineligible for coverage based on a number of exclusions established by the NFIP. Therefore, once applicants/policyholders receive the Certificate of Flood Insurance that contains a list of the policy exclusions, they should review that list to see if they are ineligible for coverage. Those applicants who fail to do this may find that their property is, in fact, not covered by the insurance policy when the next flooding incident occurs and they file for losses. Once the applicants find that their damaged buildings, contents, or both, are ineligible for coverage, they should notify the NFIP in writing in order to have their names removed from the GFIP, and to have the flood insurance maintenance requirement expunged from the data-tracking system.
</P>
<P>(10) <I>Miscellaneous.</I> Other miscellaneous items or services that FEMA, in consultation with the State, determines are necessary expenses and serious needs.

<P>(a) Legal services, including legal advice, counseling, and representation in non fee-generating cases, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, may be provided to low-income individuals who require them as a result of a major disaster. For the purpose of this section, <I>low-income individuals</I> means those disaster victims who have insufficient resources to secure adequate legal services, whether the insufficiency existed prior to or results from the major disaster. In cases where questions arise about the eligibility of an individual for legal services, the Regional Administrator or his/her representative shall make a determination.
</P>
<P>(b) Disaster legal services shall be provided free to such individuals. Fee-generating cases shall not be accepted by lawyers operating under these regulations. For purposes of this section, a fee-generating case is one which would not ordinarily be rejected by local lawyers as a result of its lack of potential remunerative value. Where any question arises as to whether a case is fee-generating as defined in this section, the Regional Administrator or his/her representative, after any necessary consultation with local or State bar associations, shall make the determination. Any fee-generating cases shall be referred by the Regional Administrator or his/her representative to private lawyers, through existing lawyer referral services, or, where that is impractical or impossible, the Regional Administrator may provide a list of lawyers from which the disaster victim may choose. Lawyers who have rendered voluntary legal assistance under these regulations are not precluded from taking fee-generating cases referred to them in this manner while in their capacity as private lawyers.
</P>
<P>(c) When the Regional Administrator determines after any necessary consultation with the State Coordinating Officer, that implementation of this section is necessary, provision of disaster legal services may be accomplished by:
</P>
<P>(1) Use of volunteer lawyers under the terms of appropriate agreements;
</P>
<P>(2) Use of Federal lawyers, provided that these lawyers do not represent an eligible disaster victim before a court or Federal agency in a matter directly involving the United States, and further provided that these lawyers do not act in a way which will violate the standards of conduct of their respective agencies or departments;
</P>
<P>(3) Use of private lawyers who may be paid by the Federal Emergency Management Agency when the Regional Administrator has determined that there is no other means of obtaining adequate legal assistance for qualified disaster victims; or
</P>
<P>(4) Any other arrangement the Regional Administrator deems appropriate.
</P>
<P>The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall coordinate with appropriate Federal agencies and the appropriate national, state and local bar associations, as necessary, in the implementation of the disaster legal services programs.
</P>
<P>(d) In the event it is necessary for FEMA to pay lawyers for the provision of legal services under these regulations, the Regional Administrator, in consultation with State and local bar associations, shall determine the amount of reimbursement due to the lawyers who have provided disaster legal services at the request of the Regional Administrator. At the Regional Administrator's discretion, administrative costs of lawyers providing legal services requested by him or her may also be paid.

</P>
<P>(d) <I>State initiation of the crisis counseling program.</I> To obtain assistance under this section, the Governor or his/her authorized representative must initiate an assessment of the need for crisis counseling services within 10 days of the date of the major disaster declaration. The purpose of the assessment is to provide an estimate of the size and cost of the program needed and to determine if supplemental Federal assistance is required. The factors of the assessment must include those described in paragraphs (f)(2) (ii) and (iii) and (g)(2) (iii) and (iv) of this section.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Public or private mental health agency programs.</I> If the Governor determines during the assessment that because of unusual circumstances or serious conditions within the State or local mental health network, the State cannot carry out the crisis counseling program, he/she may identify a public or private mental health agency or organization to carry out the program or request the Regional Administrator to identify, with the assistance of the Secretary, such an agency or organization. Preference should be given to the extent feasible and practicable to those public and private agencies or organizations which are located in or do business primarily in the major disaster area.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Immediate services.</I> If, during the course of the assessment, the State determines that immediate mental health services are required because of the severity and magnitude of the disaster, and if State or local resources are insufficient to provide these services, the State may request and the Regional Administrator, upon determining that State resources are insufficient, may provide funds to the State, separate from the application process for regular program funds (described at paragraph (g) of this section).
</P>
<P>(1) The application must be submitted to the Regional Administrator no later than 14 days following the declaration of the major disaster. This application represents the Governor's agreement and/or certification:

<HEAD>§ 206.181   Use of gifts and bequests for disaster assistance purposes.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> FEMA sets forth procedures for the use of funds made possible by a bequest of funds from the late Cora C. Brown of Kansas City, Missouri, who left a portion of her estate to the United States for helping victims of natural disasters and other disasters not caused by or attributable to war. FEMA intends to use the funds, and any others that may be bequeathed under this authority, in the manner and under the conditions described below.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Purposes for awarding funds.</I> Money from the Cora Brown Fund may only be used to provided for disaster-related needs that have not been or will not be met by governmental agencies or any other organizations which have programs to address such needs; however, the fund is not intended to replace or supersede these programs. For example, if assistance is available from another source, including the Individual and Family Grant program and government-sponsored disaster loan assistance, then money from the Cora Brown Fund will not be available to the applicant for the same purpose. Listed below are the general categories of assistance which can be provided by the Cora Brown Fund:
</P>
<P>(1) Disaster-related home repair and rebuilding assistance to families for permanent housing purposes, including site acquisition and development, relocation of residences out of hazardous areas, assistance with costs associated with temporary housing or permanent rehousing (e.g., utility deposits, access, transportation, connection of utilities, etc.);
</P>
<P>(2) Disaster-related unmet needs of families who are unable to obtain adequate assistance under the Act or from other sources. Such assistance may include but is not limited to: health and safety measures; evacuation costs; assistance delineated in the Act or other Federal, State, local, or volunteer programs; hazard mitigation or floodplain management purposes; and assistance to self-employed persons (with no employees) to reestablish their businesses; and
</P>
<P>(3) Other services which alleviate human suffering and promote the well being of disaster victims. For example, services to the elderly, to children, or to handicapped persons, such as transportation, recreational programs, provision of special ramps, or hospital or home visiting services. The funds may be provided to individual disaster victims, or to benefit a group of disaster victims.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Conditions for use of the Cora Brown Fund.</I> (1) The Cora Brown Fund is available only when the President declares that a major disaster or emergency exists under the Act, only in areas designated as eligible for Federal disaster assistance through notice in the <E T="04">Federal Register,</E> and only at the discretion of the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The fund is limited to the initial endowment plus accrued interest, and this assistance program will cease when the fund is used up.
</P>
<P>(2) A disaster victim normally will receive no more than $2,000 from this fund in any one declared disaster unless the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines that a larger amount is in the best interest of the disaster victim and the Federal Government. Funds to provide service which benefit a group may be awarded in an amount determined by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, based on the Regional Administrator's recommendation.
</P>
<P>(3) The fund may not be used in a way that is inconsistent with other federally mandated disaster assistance or insurance programs, or to modify other generally applicable requirements.
</P>
<P>(4) Funds awarded to a disaster victim may be provided by FEMA jointly to the disaster victim and to a State or local agency, or volunteer organization, to enable such an agent to assist in providing the approved assistance to an applicant. Example: Repair funds may be provided jointly to an applicant and the Mennonite Disaster Service, who will coordinate the purchase of supplies and provide the labor.
</P>
<P>(5) Money from this fund will not duplicate assistance for which a person is eligible from other sources.
</P>
<P>(6) In order to comply with the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-234), as amended, any award for acquisition or construction purposes shall carry a requirement that any adequate flood insurance policy be purchased and maintained. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall determine what is adequate based on the purpose of the award.
</P>
<P>(7) The fund shall be administered in an equitable and impartial manner without discrimination on the grounds of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, or economic status.
</P>
<P>(8) Funds awarded to a disaster victim from this fund may be combined with funds from other sources.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Administrative procedures.</I> (1) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, shall be responsible for awarding funds and authorizing disbursement.
</P>
<P>(2) The Chief Financial Officer shall be responsible for fund accountability and, in coordination with the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, for liaison with the Department of the Treasury concerning the investment of excess money in the fund pursuant to the provisions contained in section 601 of the Act.
</P>
<P>(3) Each FEMA Regional Administrator may submit requests to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate on a disaster victim's behalf by providing documentation describing the needs of the disaster victim, a verification of the disaster victim's claim, a record of other assistance which has been or will be available for the same purpose, and his/her recommendation as to the items and the amount. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall review the facts and make a determination. If the award amount is below $2,000, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may appoint a designee to have approval authority; approval authority of $2,000 or above shall be retained by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall notify the Chief Financial Officer of a decision for approval, and the Chief Financial Officer shall order a check to be sent to the disaster victim (or jointly to the disaster victim and an assistance organization), through the Regional Administrator. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall also notify the Regional Administrator of the decision, whether for approval or disapproval. The Regional Administrator shall notify the disaster victim in writing, identify any award as assistance from the Cora Brown Fund, and advise the recipient of appeal procedures.
</P>
<P>(4) If the award is to be for a service to a group of disaster victims, the Regional Administrator shall submit his/her recommendation and supporting documentation to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate (or his/her designee if the award is below $2,000), who shall review the information and make a determination. In cases of approval, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall request the Chief Financial Officer to send a check to the intended recipient or provider, as appropriate. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall notify the Regional Administrator of the decision. The Regional Administrator shall notify a representative of the group in writing.
</P>
<P>(5) The Chief Financial Officer shall process requests for checks, shall keep records of disbursements and balances in the account, and shall provide the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate with quarterly reports.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Audits.</I> The Inspector General of DHS may audit the use of money in this account to determine whether the funds are being administered according to these regulations and whether the financial management of the account is adequate. The Inspector General shall provide his/her findings to the Administrator, for information, comments and appropriate action. A copy shall be provided to the Chief Financial Officer for the same purpose.

<HEAD>§ 206.191   Duplication of benefits.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Purpose.</I> This section establishes the policies for implementing the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5155, entitled Duplication of Benefits. This section relates to assistance for individuals and families.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Government policy.</I> (1) Federal agencies providing disaster assistance under the Act or under their own authorities triggered by the Act, must cooperate to prevent and rectify duplication of benefits, according to the general policy guidance of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The agencies must establish appropriate agency policies and procedures to prevent duplication of benefits.
</P>
<P>(2) Major disaster and emergency assistance provided to individuals and families under the Act, and comparable disaster assistance provided by States, local governments, and disaster assistance organizations, is not considered as income or a resource when determining eligibility for or benefit levels under federally funded income assistance or resource-tested programs. Examples of federally funded income assistance or resource-tested programs are the food stamp program and welfare assistance programs.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>FEMA policy.</I> It is FEMA policy:
</P>
<P>(1) To prevent duplication of benefits between its own programs and insurance benefits, and between its own programs and other disaster assistance. Assistance under the Act may be provided in instances where the applicant has not received other benefits to which he/she may be entitled by the time of application and if the applicant agrees to repay all duplicated assistance to the agency providing the Federal assistance;
</P>
<P>(2) To examine a debt resulting from duplication to determine that the likelihood of collecting the debt and the best interests of the Federal Government justify taking the necessary recovery actions to remedy duplication which has occurred when other assistance has become available;
</P>
<P>(3) To assure uniformity in preventing duplication of benefits, by consulting with other Federal agencies and by performing selected quality control reviews, that the other disaster relief agencies establish and follow policies and procedures to prevent and remedy duplication among their programs, other programs, and insurance benefits; and
</P>
<P>(4) To coordinate the effort of agencies providing assistance so that each agency understands the prevention and remedial policies of the others and is able to fulfill its own responsibilities regarding duplication of benefits.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Guidance to prevent duplication of benefits.</I> (1) Delivery sequence. FEMA provides the following policy and procedural guidance to ensure uniformity in preventing duplication of benefits.
</P>
<P>(i) Duplication occurs when an agency has provided assistance which was the primary responsibility of another agency, and the agency with primary responsibility later provides assistance. A delivery sequence establishes the order in which disaster relief agencies and organizations provide assistance. The specific sequence, in accordance with the mandates of the assistance programs, is to be generally followed in the delivery of assistance.
</P>
<P>(ii) When the delivery sequence has been disrupted, the disrupting agency is responsible for rectifying the duplication. The delivery sequence pertains to that period of time in the recovery phase when most of the traditional disaster assistance programs are available.
</P>
<P>(2) The delivery sequence is, in order of delivery:
</P>
<P>(i) Volunteer agencies' emergency assistance (except expendable items such as clothes, linens, and basic kitchenware); insurance (including flood insurance);

 
</P>
<P>(ii) Housing assistance pursuant to the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174;
</P>
<P>(iii) Other Needs assistance, pursuant to the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5174;
</P>
<P>(iv) Small Business Administration and Department of Agriculture disaster loans;
</P>
<P>(v) Volunteer agencies' “additional assistance” programs; and
</P>
<P>(vi) The “Cora Brown Fund.”
</P>
<P>(3) Two significant points about the delivery sequence are that:
</P>
<P>(i) Each assistance agency should, in turn, offer and be responsible for delivering assistance without regard to duplication with a program later in the sequence; and
</P>
<P>(ii) The sequence itself determines what types of assistance can duplicate other assistance (i.e., a Federal program can duplicate insurance benefits, however, insurance benefits cannot duplicate the Federal assistance). An agency's position in the sequence determines the order in which it should provide assistance and what other resources it must consider before it does so.
</P>
<P>(4) If following the delivery sequence concept would adversely affect the timely receipt of essential assistance by an individual or household, an agency may offer assistance which is the primary responsibility of another agency. There also may be cases when an agency (Agency B) delivers assistance which is normally the primary responsibility of another agency (Agency A) because Agency A has, for good cause, denied assistance. After the assistance is delivered, Agency A reopens the case. If the primary response Agency A then provides assistance, that Agency A is responsible for coordinating with Agency B to either:
</P>
<P>(i) Assist Agency B in preventing the duplication of benefits, or
</P>
<P>(ii) In the case where the individual or household has refused assistance from Agency A, Agency A must notify Agency B that it must recover assistance previously provided.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Program guidance</I>—(1) <I>Programs under the Act vs. other agency assistance.</I> (i) In making an eligibility determination, FEMA, in the case of federally operated programs, or the State, in the case of State operated programs, must determine whether assistance is the primary responsibility of another agency to provide, according to the delivery sequence; and determine whether that primary response agency can provide assistance in a timely way.
</P>
<P>(ii) If it is determined that timely assistance can be provided by the agency with primary responsibility, refrain from providing assistance under the Act. If it is determined that assistance from the agency with primary responsibility will be delayed, assistance under the Act may be provided, but then must be recovered from the applicant when the other assistance becomes available.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Programs under the Act vs. insurance.</I> In making an eligibility determination, FEMA or the State must:
</P>
<P>(i) Remind the applicant about his/her responsibility to pursue an adequate settlement. The applicant must provide information concerning insurance recoveries.
</P>
<P>(ii) Determine whether the applicant's insurance settlement will be sufficient to cover the loss or need without disaster assistance; and
</P>
<P>(iii) Determine whether insurance benefits (including flood insurance) will be provided in a timely way. Where flood insurance is involved, FEMA must coordinate with the Federal Insurance Administration. The purpose of this coordination is to obtain information about flood insurance coverage and settlements.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Random sample.</I> Each disaster assistance agency is responsible for preventing and rectifying duplication of benefits under the general authority of the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5155. To determine whether duplication has occurred and established procedures have been followed, FEMA must, within 90 days after the close of the disaster assistance program's application period, for selected disaster declarations, examine on a random sample basis, FEMA's and other government and voluntary agencies' case files and document the findings in writing.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Duplication when assistance under the Act is involved.</I> If duplication is discovered, FEMA must determine whether the duplicating agency followed its own remedial procedures.
</P>
<P>(i) If the duplicating agency followed its procedures and was successful in correcting the duplication, FEMA will take no further action. If the agency was not successful in correcting the duplication, and FEMA is satisfied that the duplicating agency followed its remedial procedures, no further action will be taken.
</P>
<P>(ii) If the duplicating agency did not follow its duplication of benefits procedures, or FEMA is not satisfied that the procedures were followed in an acceptable manner, then FEMA must provide an opportunity for the agency to take the required corrective action. If the agency cannot fulfill its responsibilities for remedial action, FEMA must notify the recipient of the excess assistance, and after examining the debt, then as appropriate, take those recovery actions in conjunction with agency representatives for each identified case in the random sample (or larger universe, at FEMA's discretion).
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Duplication when assistance under other authorities is involved.</I> When the random sample shows evidence that duplication has occurred and corrective action is required, FEMA must urge the duplicating agency to follow its own procedures to take corrective action, and must work with the agency toward that end. Under its authority in the Stafford Act, 42 U.S.C. 5155, FEMA must require the duplicating agency to report to FEMA on the agency's attempt to correct the duplications identified in the sample.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Recovering FEMA funds: debt collection.</I> Funds due to FEMA are recovered in accordance with the Department of Homeland Security's Debt Collection Regulations (6 CFR part 11—Claims) and the Federal Claims Collection Standards (Department of the Treasury—Department of Justice) (31 CFR chapter IX). Section 1216 of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018, 42 U.S.C. 5174a, also provides FEMA the authority to waive debts owed by individuals and households who received assistance under subpart D of this part.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Severability.</I> Any provision of this section held to be invalid or unenforceable as applied to any person or circumstance should be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect to the provision permitted by law, including as applied to persons not similarly situated or to dissimilar circumstances, unless such holding is that the provision of this section is invalid and unenforceable in all circumstances, in which event the provision should be severable from the remainder of this section and should not affect the remainder thereof.

<P>(a) <I>Purpose.</I> This subpart establishes procedures for the administration of Public Assistance grants approved under the provisions of the Stafford Act.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>What policies apply to FEMA public assistance grants?</I> (1) The Stafford Act requires that we deliver eligible assistance as quickly and efficiently as possible consistent with Federal laws and regulations. We expect the recipient and the subrecipient to adhere to Stafford Act requirements and to these regulations when administering our public assistance grants.
</P>
<P>(2) The regulations entitled “Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards,” published at 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002, place requirements on the State in its role as recipient and gives the recipient discretion to administer federal programs under their own procedures. We expect the recipient to:
</P>
<P>(i) Inform subrecipients about the status of their applications, including notifications of our approvals of Project Worksheets and our estimates of when we will make payments;
</P>
<P>(ii) Pay the full amounts due to subrecipients as soon as practicable after we approve payment, including the State contribution required in the FEMA-State Agreement; and
</P>
<P>(iii) Pay the State contribution consistent with State laws.

</P>
<P>(e) <I>Hazard mitigation</I> means any cost effective measure which will reduce the potential for damage to a facility from a disaster event.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Host-State.</I> A State or Indian Tribal government that by agreement with FEMA provides sheltering and/or evacuation support to evacuees from an impact-State. An Indian Tribal government may also be referred to as a “Host-Tribe.”
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Impact-State.</I> The State for which the President has declared an emergency or major disaster and that, due to a need to evacuate and/or shelter affected individuals outside the State, requests such assistance from FEMA pursuant to § 206.208.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Indian Tribal government</I> means any federally recognized governing body of an Indian or Alaska Native Tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or community that the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges to exist as an Indian Tribe under the Federally Recognized Tribe List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. 479a. This does not include Alaska Native corporations, the ownership of which is vested in private individuals.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Permanent work</I> means that restorative work that must be performed through repairs or replacement, to restore an eligible facility on the basis of its predisaster design and current applicable standards.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Predisaster design</I> means the size or capacity of a facility as originally designed and constructed or subsequently modified by changes or additions to the original design. It does not mean the capacity at which the facility was being used at the time the major disaster occurred if different from the most recent designed capacity.

<HEAD>§ 206.202   Application procedures.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> This section describes the policies and procedures that we use to process public assistance grants to States. Under this section the State is the recipient. As recipient you are responsible for processing subgrants to applicants under 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002, and 44 CFR part 206, and your own policies and procedures.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Recipient.</I> You are the grant administrator for all funds provided under the Public Assistance grant program. Your responsibilities under this section include:
</P>
<P>(1) Providing technical advice and assistance to eligible subrecipients;
</P>
<P>(2) Providing State support for project identification activities to include small and large project formulation and the validation of small projects;
</P>
<P>(3) Ensuring that all potential applicants are aware of available public assistance; and
</P>
<P>(4) Submitting documents necessary for the award of grants.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Request for Public Assistance (Request).</I> The recipient must send a completed <I>Request</I> (FEMA Form 90-49) to the Regional Administrator for each applicant who requests public assistance. You must send <I>Requests</I> to the Regional Administrator within 30 days after designation of the area where the damage occurred.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Project Worksheets.</I> (1) An applicant's authorized local representative is responsible for representing the applicant and for ensuring that the applicant has identified all eligible work and submitted all costs for disaster-related damages for funding.
</P>
<P>(i) We or the applicant, assisted by the State as appropriate, will prepare a Project Worksheet (FEMA Form 90-91) for each project. The Project Worksheet must identify the eligible scope of work and must include a quantitative estimate for the eligible work.
</P>
<P>(ii) The applicant will have 60 days following its first substantive meeting with us to identify and to report damage to us.
</P>
<P>(2) When the estimated cost of work on a project is less than $3,000, that work is not eligible and we will not approve a Project Worksheet for the project. Such $3,000 amount shall be adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Grant approval.</I> (1) Before we obligate any funds to the State, the recipient must complete and send to the Regional Administrator a Standard Form (SF) 424, Application for Federal Assistance, and a SF 424D, Assurances for Construction Programs. After we receive the SF 424 and SF 424D, the Regional Administrator will obligate funds to the recipient based on the approved Project Worksheets. The recipient will then approve subgrants based on the Project Worksheets approved for each applicant.
</P>
<P>(2) When the applicant submits the Project Worksheets, we will have 45 days to obligate Federal funds. If we have a delay beyond 45 days we will explain the delay to the recipient.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Exceptions.</I> The following are exceptions to the procedures and time limitations outlined in this section.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Host-State Evacuation and/or Sheltering</I>—(i) <I>General.</I> A grant to a host-State for sheltering and/or evacuation support is available under this section when an impact-State requests direct Federal assistance for sheltering and/or evacuation support pursuant to § 206.208. To receive this grant, a host-State must enter into a FEMA-Host-State Agreement, amend its State Administrative Plan pursuant to § 206.207, and submit a Standard Form SF424 <I>Application for Federal Assistance</I> directly to FEMA to apply for reimbursement of eligible costs for evacuating and/or sheltering individuals from an impact-State. Upon award, the host-State assumes the responsibilities of the “recipient” or “State” under this part with respect to its grant award.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Force Account Labor Costs.</I> For the performance of eligible evacuation and sheltering support under sections 403 or 502 of the Stafford Act, the straight-time salaries and benefits of a host-State's permanently employed personnel are eligible for reimbursement. This is an exception to § 206.228(a)(2).
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Time limitations.</I> The Regional Administrator may extend the time limitations shown in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section when the recipient justifies and makes a request in writing. The justification must be based on extenuating circumstances beyond the recipient's or subrecipient's control.

<HEAD>§ 206.203   Federal grant assistance.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> This section describes the types and extent of Federal funding available under State disaster assistance grants, as well as limitations and special procedures applicable to each.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Cost sharing.</I> All projects approved under State disaster assistance grants will be subject to the cost sharing provisions established in the FEMA-State Agreement and the Stafford Act.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Project funding</I>—(1) <I>Large projects.</I> When the approved estimate of eligible costs for an individual project is $1,000,000 or greater, Federal funding shall equal the Federal share of the actual eligible costs documented by a recipient. Such $1,000,000 amount shall be adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Small projects.</I> When the approved estimate of costs for an individual project is less than $1,000,000, Federal funding shall equal the Federal share of the approved estimate of eligible costs. Such $1,000,000 amount shall be adjusted annually as indicated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Applicability date.</I> The dollar threshold provided in this paragraph (c) applies to project worksheets that have not been obligated as of August 3, 2022 for major disasters and emergencies declared on or after March 13, 2020.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Funding options</I>—(1) <I>Improved projects.</I> If a subrecipient desires to make improvements, but still restore the predisaster function of a damaged facility, the recipient's approval must be obtained. Federal funding for such improved projects shall be limited to the Federal share of the approved estimate of eligible costs.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Alternate projects.</I> In any case where a subrecipient determines that the public welfare would not be best served by restoring a damaged public facility or the function of that facility, the recipient may request that the Regional Administrator approve an alternate project.
</P>
<P>(i) The alternate project option may be taken only on permanent restorative work.
</P>
<P>(ii) Federal funding for alternate projects for damaged public facilities will be 90 percent of the Federal share of the Federal estimate of the cost of repairing, restoring, reconstructing, or replacing the facility and of management expenses.
</P>
<P>(iii) Federal funding for alternate projects for damaged private nonprofit facilities will be 75 percent of the Federal share of the Federal estimate of the cost of repairing, restoring, reconstructing, or replacing the facility and of management expenses.
</P>
<P>(iv) Funds contributed for alternate projects may be used to repair or expand other selected public facilities, to construct new facilities, or to fund hazard mitigation measures. These funds may not be used to pay the nonFederal share of any project, nor for any operating expense.
</P>
<P>(v) Prior to the start of construction of any alternate project the recipient shall submit for approval by the Regional Administrator the following: a description of the proposed alternate project(s); a schedule of work; and the projected cost of the project(s). The recipient shall also provide the necessary assurances to document compliance with special requirements, including, but not limited to floodplain management, environmental assessment, hazard mitigation, protection of wetlands, and insurance.

</P>
<P>(d) <I>Requests for time extensions.</I> Requests for time extensions beyond the recipient's authority shall be submitted by the recipient to the Regional Administrator and shall include the following:
</P>
<P>(1) The dates and provisions of all previous time extensions on the project; and
</P>
<P>(2) A detailed justification for the delay and a projected completion date. The Regional Administrator shall review the request and make a determination. The recipient shall be notified of the Regional Administrator's determination in writing. If the Regional Administrator approves the request, the letter shall reflect the approved completion date and any other requirements the Regional Administrator may determine necessary to ensure that the new completion date is met. If the Regional Administrator denies the time extension request, the recipient may, upon completion of the project, be reimbursed for eligible project costs incurred only up to the latest approved completion date. If the project is not completed, no Federal funding will be provided for that project.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Cost Overruns.</I> (1) During the execution of approved work a subrecipient may find that the actual project costs exceed the approved Project Worksheet estimates. Such cost overruns normally fall into the following three categories:
</P>
<P>(i) Variations in unit prices;
</P>
<P>(ii) Change in the scope of eligible work; or 
</P>
<P>(iii) Delays in timely starts or completion of eligible work.
</P>
<P>(2) The subrecipient must evaluate each cost overrun and, when justified, submit a request for additional funding through the recipient to the Regional Administrator for a final determination. All requests for the Regional Administrator's approval will contain sufficient documentation to support the eligibility of all claimed work and costs. The recipient must include a written recommendation when forwarding the request. The Regional Administrator will notify the recipient in writing of the final determination. FEMA will not normally review an overrun for an individual small project. The normal procedure for small projects will be that when a subrecipient discovers a significant overrun related to the total final cost for all small projects, the subrecipient may submit an appeal for additional funding in accordance with § 206.206, within 60 days following the completion of all its small projects.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Progress reports.</I> Progress reports will be submitted by the recipient to the Regional Administrator quarterly. The Regional Administrator and recipient shall negotiate the date for submission of the first report. Such reports will describe the status of those projects on which a final payment of the Federal share has not been made to the recipient and outline any problems or circumstances expected to result in noncompliance with the approved grant conditions.

The recipient will make payment of the Federal share to the subrecipient as soon as practicable after Federal approval of funding. Before the closeout of the disaster contract, the recipient must certify that all such projects were completed in accordance with FEMA approvals and that the State contribution to the non-Federal share, as specified in the FEMA-State Agreement, has been paid to each subrecipient. Such certification is not required to specify the amount spent by a subrecipient on small projects.

<HEAD>§ 206.208   Direct Federal assistance.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> When the State and local government lack the capability to perform or to contract for eligible emergency work and/or debris removal, under sections 402(1) and (4), 403, 407, 502(a)(1), (5) and (7) of the Act, the recipient may request that the work be accomplished by a Federal agency. Such assistance is subject to the cost sharing provisions outlined in § 206.203(b) of this subpart. Direct Federal assistance is also subject to the eligibility criteria contained in Subpart H of these regulations. FEMA will reimburse other Federal agencies in accordance with Subpart A of these regulations.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Requests for assistance.</I> All requests for direct Federal assistance shall be submitted by the recipient to the Regional Administrator and shall include:
</P>
<P>(1) A written agreement that the State will:
</P>
<P>(i) Provide without cost to the United States all lands, easements and rights-of-ways necessary to accomplish the approved work;
</P>
<P>(ii) Hold and save the United States free from damages due to the requested work, and shall indemnify the Federal Government against any claims arising from such work;
</P>
<P>(iii) Provide reimbursement to FEMA for the nonFederal share of the cost of such work in accordance with the provisions of the FEMA-State Agreement; and
</P>
<P>(iv) Assist the performing Federal agency in all support and local jurisdictional matters.
</P>
<P>(2) A statement as to the reasons the State and the local government cannot perform or contract for performance of the requested work.
</P>
<P>(3) A written agreement from an eligible applicant that such applicant will be responsible for the items in subparagraph (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, in the event that a State is legally unable to provide the written agreement.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Implementation.</I> (1) If the Regional Administrator approves the request, a mission assignment will be issued to the appropriate Federal agency. The mission assignment letter to the agency will define the scope of eligible work, the estimated cost of the eligible work and the billing period frequency. The Federal agency must not exceed the approved funding limit without the authorization of the Regional Administrator.
</P>
<P>(2) If all or any part of the requested work falls within the statutory authority of another Federal agency, the Regional Administrator shall not approve that portion of the work. In such case, the unapproved portion of the request will be referred to the appropriate agency for action.
</P>
<P>(3) If an impact-State requests assistance in providing evacuation and sheltering support outside an impact-State, FEMA may directly reimburse a host-State for such eligible costs through a grant to a host-State under an impact-State's declaration, consistent with § 206.202(f)(1). FEMA may award a grant to a host-State when FEMA determines that a host-State has sufficient capability to meet some or all of the sheltering and/or evacuation needs of an impact-State, and a host-State agrees in writing to provide such support to an impact-State.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Time limitation.</I> The time limitation for completion of work by a Federal agency under a mission assignment is 60 days after the President's declaration. Based on extenuating circumstances or unusual project requirements, the Regional Administrator may extend this time limitation.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Project management.</I> (1) The performing Federal agency shall ensure that the work is completed in accordance with the Regional Administrator's approved scope of work, costs and time limitations. The performing Federal agency shall also keep the Regional Administrator and recipient advised of work progress and other project developments. It is the responsibility of the performing Federal agency to ensure compliance with applicable Federal, State and local legal requirements. A final inspection report will be completed upon termination of all direct Federal assistance work. Final inspection reports shall be signed by a representative of the performing Federal agency and the State. Once the final eligible cost is determined (including Federal agency overhead), the State will be billed for the nonFederal share of the mission assignment in accordance with the cost sharing provisions of the FEMA-State Agreement.
</P>
<P>(2) Pursuant to the agreements provided in the request for assistance the recipient shall assist the performing Federal agency in all State and local jurisdictional matters. These matters include securing local building permits and rights of entry, control of traffic and pedestrians, and compliance with local building ordinances.

<HEAD>§ 206.226   Restoration of damaged facilities.</HEAD>
<P>Work to restore eligible facilities on the basis of the design of such facilities as they existed immediately prior to the disaster and in conformity with the following is eligible:
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Assistance under other Federal agency (OFA) programs.</I> (1) Generally, disaster assistance will not be made available under the Stafford Act when another Federal agency has specific authority to restore facilities damaged or destroyed by an event which is declared a major disaster.
</P>
<P>(2) An exception to the policy described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section exists for public elementary and secondary school facilities which are otherwise eligible for assistance from the Department of Education (ED) under 20 U.S.C. 241-1 and 20 U.S.C. 646. Such facilities are also eligible for assistance from FEMA under the Stafford Act, and recipients shall accept applications from local educational agencies for assistance under the Stafford Act.
</P>
<P>(3) The exception does not cover payment of increased current operating expenses or replacement of lost revenues as provided in 20 U.S.C. 241-1(a) and implemented by 34 CFR 219.14. Such assistance shall continue to be granted and administered by the Department of Education.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Mitigation planning.</I> In order to receive assistance under this section, the State or Indian Tribal government applying to FEMA as a recipient must have in place a FEMA approved State or Tribal Mitigation Plan, as applicable, in accordance with 44 CFR part 201.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Private nonprofit facilities.</I> Eligible private nonprofit facilities may receive funding under the following conditions: 
</P>
<P>(1) The facility provides critical services, which include power, water (including water provided by an irrigation organization or facility in accordance with § 206.221(e)(3)), sewer services, wastewater treatment, communications, emergency medical care, fire department services, emergency rescue, and nursing homes; or 
</P>
<P>(2) The private nonprofit organization not falling within the criteria of § 206.226(c)(1) has applied for a disaster loan under section 7(b) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.636(b)) and 
</P>
<P>(i) The Small Business Administration has declined the organization's application; or 
</P>
<P>(ii) Has eligible damages greater than the maximum amount of the loan for which it is eligible, in which case the excess damages are eligible for FEMA assistance. 
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Standards.</I> For the costs of Federal, State, and local repair or replacement standards which change the predisaster construction of facility to be eligible, the standards must:
</P>
<P>(1) Apply to the type of repair or restoration required;
</P>
<FP>(Standards may be different for new construction and repair work)
</FP>
<P>(2) Be appropriate to the predisaster use of the facility;
</P>
<P>(3)(i) Be found reasonable, in writing, and formally adopted and implemented by the State or local government on or before the disaster declaration date or be a legal Federal requirement applicable to the type of restoration.
</P>
<P>(ii) This paragraph (d) applies to local governments on January 1, 1999 and to States on January 1, 2000. Until the respective applicability dates, the standards must be in writing and formally adopted by the applicant prior to project approval or be a legal Federal or State requirement applicable to the type of restoration.
</P>
<P>(4) Apply uniformly to all similar types of facilities within the jurisdiction of owner of the facility; and
</P>
<P>(5) For any standard in effect at the time of a disaster, it must have been enforced during the time it was in effect.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Hazard mitigation.</I> In approving grant assistance for restoration of facilities, the Regional Administrator may require cost effective hazard mitigation measures not required by applicable standards. The cost of any requirements for hazard mitigation placed on restoration projects by FEMA will be an eligible cost for FEMA assistance.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Repair vs. replacement.</I> (1) A facility is considered repairable when disaster damages do not exceed 50 percent of the cost of replacing a facility to its predisaster condition, and it is feasible to repair the facility so that it can perform the function for which it was being used as well as it did immediately prior to the disaster.
</P>
<P>(2) If a damaged facility is not repairable in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section, approved restorative work may include replacement of the facility. The applicant may elect to perform repairs to the facility, in lieu of replacement, if such work is in conformity with applicable standards. However, eligible costs shall be limited to the less expensive of repairs or replacement.
</P>
<P>(3) An exception to the limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section may be allowed for facilities eligible for or on the National Register of Historic Properties. If an applicable standard requires repair in a certain manner, costs associated with that standard will be eligible.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Relocation.</I> (1) The Regional Administrator may approve funding for and require restoration of a destroyed facility at a new location when:
</P>
<P>(i) The facility is and will be subject to repetitive heavy damage;
</P>
<P>(ii) The approval is not barred by other provisions of title 44 CFR; and
</P>
<P>(iii) The overall project, including all costs, is cost effective.
</P>
<P>(2) When relocation is required by the Regional Administrator, eligible work includes land acquisition and ancillary facilities such as roads and utilities, in addition to work normally eligible as part of a facility reconstruction. Demolition and removal of the old facility is also an eligible cost.
</P>
<P>(3) When relocation is required by the Regional Administrator, no future funding for repair or replacement of a facility at the original site will be approved, except those facilities which facilitate an open space use in accordance with 44 CFR part 9.
</P>
<P>(4) When relocation is required by the Regional Administrator, and, instead of relocation, the applicant requests approval of an alternate project [see § 206.203(d)(2)], eligible costs will be limited to 90 percent of the estimate of restoration at the original location excluding hazard mitigation measures.
</P>
<P>(5) If relocation of a facility is not feasible or cost effective, the Regional Administrator shall disapprove Federal funding for the original location when he/she determines in accordance with 44 CFR parts 9, 10, 201, or subpart M of this part 206, that restoration in the original location is not allowed. In such cases, an alternative project may be applied for. 
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Equipment and furnishings.</I> If equipment and furnishings are damaged beyond repair, comparable items are eligible as replacement items.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Library books and publications.</I> Replacement of library books and publications is based on an inventory of the quantities of various categories of books or publications damaged or destroyed. Cataloging and other work incidental to replacement are eligible.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Beaches.</I> (1) Replacement of sand on an unimproved natural beach is not eligible.
</P>
<P>(2) Improved beaches. Work on an improved beach may be eligible under the following conditions:
</P>
<P>(i) The beach was constructed by the placement of sand (of proper grain size) to a designed elevation, width, and slope; and
</P>
<P>(ii) A maintenance program involving periodic renourishment of sand must have been established and adhered to by the applicant.
</P>
<P>(k) <I>Restrictions</I>—(1) <I>Alternative use facilities.</I> If a facility was being used for purposes other than those for which it was designed, restoration will only be eligible to the extent necessary to restore the immediate predisaster alternate purpose.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Inactive facilities.</I> Facilities that were not in active use at the time of the disaster are not eligible except in those instances where the facilities were only temporarily inoperative for repairs or remodeling, or where active use by the applicant was firmly established in an approved budget or the owner can demonstrate to FEMA's satisfaction an intent to begin use within a reasonable time.

<HEAD>§ 206.253   Insurance requirements for facilities damaged by disasters other than flood.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Prior to approval of a Federal grant for the restoration of a facility and its contents which were damaged by a disaster other than flood, the recipient shall notify the Regional Administrator of any entitlement to insurance settlement or recovery for such facility and its contents. The Regional Administrator shall reduce the eligible costs by the actual amount of insurance proceeds relating to the eligible costs.
</P>
<P>(b)(1) Assistance under section 406 of the Stafford Act will be approved only on the condition that the recipient obtain and maintain such types and amounts of insurance as are reasonable and necessary to protect against future loss to such property from the types of hazard which caused the major disaster. The extent of insurance to be required will be based on the eligible damage that was incurred to the damaged facility as a result of the major disaster. The Regional Administrator shall not require greater types and extent of insurance than are certified as reasonable by the State Insurance Commissioner.
</P>
<P>(2) Due to the high cost of insurance, some applicants may request to insure the damaged facilities under a blanket insurance policy covering all their facilities, an insurance pool arrangement, or some combination of these options. Such an arrangement may be accepted for other than flood damages. However, if the same facility is damaged in a similar future disaster, eligible costs will be reduced by the amount of eligible damage sustained on the previous disaster.
</P>
<P>(c) The Regional Administrator shall notify the recipient of the type and amount of insurance required. The recipient may request that the State Insurance Commissioner review the type and extent of insurance required to protect against future loss to a disaster-damaged facility, the Regional Administrator shall not require greater types and extent of insurance than are certified as reasonable by the State Insurance Commissioner.
</P>
<P>(d) The requirements of section 311 of the Stafford Act are waived when eligible costs for an insurable facility do not exceed $5,000. The Regional Administrator may establish a higher waiver amount based on hazard mitigation initiatives which reduce the risk of future damages by a disaster similar to the one which resulted in the major disaster declaration which is the basis for the application for disaster assistance.
</P>
<P>(e) The recipient shall provide assurances that the required insurance coverage will be maintained for the anticipated life of the restorative work or the insured facility, whichever is the lesser.
</P>
<P>(f) No assistance shall be provided under section 406 of the Stafford Act for any facility for which assistance was provided as a result of a previous major disaster unless all insurance required by FEMA as a condition of the previous assistance has been obtained and maintained.

<HEAD>§ 206.340   Purpose of subpart.</HEAD>
<P>This subpart implements the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) (Pub. L. 97-348) as that statute applies to disaster relief granted to individuals and State and local governments under the Stafford Act. CBRA prohibits new expenditures and new financial assistance within the Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) for all but a few types of activities identified in CBRA. This subpart specifies what actions may and may not be carried out within the CBRS. It establishes procedures for compliance with CBRA in the administration of disaster assistance by FEMA.

<HEAD>§ 206.341   Policy.</HEAD>
<P>It shall be the policy of FEMA to achieve the goals of CBRA in carrying out disaster relief on units of the Coastal Barrier Resources System. It is FEMA's intent that such actions be consistent with the purpose of CBRA to minimize the loss of human life, the wasteful expenditure of Federal revenues, and the damage to fish, wildlife and other natural resources associated with coastal barriers along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and to consider the means and measures by which the long-term conservation of these fish, wildlife, and other natural resources may be achieved under the Stafford Act.

<HEAD>§ 206.342   Definitions.</HEAD>
<P>Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the definitions set forth in part 206 of subchapter D are applicable to this subject.
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Consultation</I> means that process by which FEMA informs the Secretary of the Interior through his/her designated agent of FEMA proposed disaster assistance actions on a designated unit of the Coastal Barrier Resources System and by which the Secretary makes comments to FEMA about the appropriateness of that action. Approval by the Secretary is not required in order that an action be carried out.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Essential link</I> means that portion of a road, utility, or other facility originating outside of the system unit but providing access or service through the unit and for which no alternative route is reasonably available.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Existing facility</I> on a unit of CBRS established by Public Law 97-348 means a publicly owned or operated facility on which the start of a construction took place prior to October 18, 1982, and for which this fact can be adequately documented. In addition, a legally valid building permit or equivalent documentation, if required, must have been obtained for the construction prior to October 18, 1982. If a facility has been substantially improved or expanded since October 18, 1982, it is not an existing facility. For any other unit added to the CBRS by amendment to Public Law 97-348, the enactment date of such amendment is substituted for October 18, 1982, in this definition.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Expansion</I> means changing a facility to increase its capacity or size.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Facility</I> means “public facility” as defined in § 206.201. This includes any publicly owned flood control, navigation, irrigation, reclamation, public power, sewage treatment and collection, water supply and distribution, watershed development, or airport facility; and nonfederal-aid street, road, or highway; and any other public building, structure, or system, including those used for educational, recreational, or cultural purposes, or any park.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Financial assistance</I> means any form of Federal loan, grant guaranty, insurance, payment rebate, subsidy or any other form of direct or indirect Federal assistance.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>New financial assistance</I> on a unit of the CBRS established by Public Law 97-348 means an approval by FEMA of a project application or other disaster assistance after October 18, 1982. For any other unit added to the CBRS by amendment to Public Law 97-348, the enactment date such amendment is substituted for October 18, 1982, in this definition.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Start of construction</I> for a structure means the first placement of permanent construction, such as the placement of footings or slabs or any work beyond the stage of excavation. Permanent construction for a structure does not include land preparation such as clearing, grading, and placement of fill, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, or piers. For a facility which is not a structure, start of construction means the first activity for permanent construction of a substantial part of the facility. Permanent construction for a facility does not include land preparation such as clearing and grubbing but would include excavation and placement of fill such as for a road.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Structure</I> means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a mobile home.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Substantial improvement</I> means any repair, reconstruction or other improvement of a structure or facility, that has been damaged in excess of, or the cost of which equals or exceeds, 50 percent of the market value of the structure or placement cost of the facility (including all “public facilities”) as defined in the Stafford Act) either:
</P>
<P>(1) Before the repair or improvement is started; or
</P>
<P>(2) If the structure or facility has been damaged and is proposed to be restored, before the damage occurred. If a facility is a link in a larger system, the percentage of damage will be based on the relative cost of repairing the damaged facility to the replacement cost of that portion of the system which is operationally dependent on the facility. The term <I>substantial improvement</I> does not include any alternation of a structure or facility listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>(k) <I>System unit</I> means any undeveloped coastal barrier, or combination of closely related undeveloped coastal barriers included within the Coastal Barrier Resources System as established by the section 4 of the CBRA, or as modified by the Secretary in accordance with that statute.

This rate is from the monthly Treasury schedule of certified interest rates which takes into consideration the current average yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States, adjusted to the nearest 
<FR>1/8</FR> percent.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Time limitation.</I> The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may approve a loan in either the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred or the fiscal year immediately following that year. Only one loan may be approved under section 417(a) for any local government as the result of a single disaster.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Term of loan.</I> The term of the loan is 5 years, unless otherwise extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may consider requests for an extensions of loans based on the local government's financial condition. The total term of any loan under section 417(a) normally may not exceed 10 years from the date the Promissory Note was executed. However, when extenuating circumstances exist and the Community Disaster Loan recipient demonstrates an inability to repay the loan within the initial 10 years, but agrees to repay such loan over an extended period of time, additional time may be provided for loan repayment. (See § 206.367(c).)
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Use of loan funds.</I> The local government shall use the loaned funds to carry on existing local government functions of a municipal operation character or to expand such functions to meet disaster-related needs. The funds shall not be used to finance capital improvements nor the repair or restoration of damaged public facilities. Neither the loan nor any cancelled portion of the loans may be used as the nonFederal share of any Federal program, including those under the Act.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Cancellation.</I> The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Community Disaster Loan to the extent that he/she determines that revenues of the local government during the 3 fiscal years following the disaster are insufficient to meet the operating budget of that local government because of disaster-related revenue losses and additional unreimbursed disaster-related municipal operating expenses.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Relation to other assistance.</I> Any community disaster loans including cancellations made under this subpart shall not reduce or otherwise affect any commitments, grants, or other assistance under the Act or these regulations.

<P>(a) <I>Local government.</I> (1) The local government must be located within the area designated by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate as eligible for assistance under a major disaster declaration. In addition, State law must not prohibit the local government from incurring the indebtedness resulting from a Federal loan.
</P>
<P>(2) Criteria considered by FEMA in determining the eligibility of a local government for a Community Disaster Loan include the loss of tax and other revenues as result of a major disaster, a demonstrated need for financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions, the maintenance of an annual operating budget, and the responsibility to provide essential municipal operating services to the community. Eligibility for other assistance under the Act does not, by itself, establish entitlement to such a loan.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Loan eligibility</I>—(1) <I>General.</I> To be eligible, the local government must show that it may suffer or has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster or emergency, must demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions, and must not be in arrears with respect to any payments due on previous loans. Loan eligibility is based on the financial condition of the local government and a review of financial information and supporting documentation accompanying the application. 
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Substantial loss of tax and other revenues.</I> The fiscal year of the disaster or the succeeding fiscal year is the base period for determining whether a local government may suffer or has suffered a substantial loss of revenue. Criteria used in determining whether a local government has or may suffer a substantial loss of tax and other revenue include the following disaster-related factors:
</P>
<P>(i) Whether the disaster caused a large enough reduction in cash receipts from normal revenue sources, excluding borrowing, which affects significantly and adversely the level and/or categories of essential municipal services provided prior to the disaster;
</P>
<P>(ii) Whether the disaster caused a revenue loss of over 5 percent of total revenue estimated for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred or for the succeeding fiscal year;
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Demonstrated need for financial assistance.</I> The local government must demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions. The criteria used in making this determination include the following:
</P>
<P>(i) Whether there are sufficient funds to meet current fiscal year operating requirements;
</P>
<P>(ii) Whether there is availability of cash or other liquid assets from the prior fiscal year;
</P>
<P>(iii) Current financial condition considering projected expenditures for governmental services and availability of other financial resources;
</P>
<P>(iv) Ability to obtain financial assistance or needed revenue from State and other Federal agencies for direct program expenditures;
</P>
<P>(v) Debt ratio (relationship of annual receipts to debt service);
</P>
<P>(vi) Ability to obtain financial assistance or needed revenue from State and other Federal agencies for direct program expenditures;
</P>
<P>(vii) Displacement of revenue-producing business due to property destruction;

<HEAD>§ 206.364   Loan application.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Application.</I> (1) The local government shall submit an application for a Community Disaster Loan through the GAR. The loan must be justified on the basis of need and shall be based on the actual and projected expenses, as a result of the disaster, for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred and for the 3 succeeding fiscal years. The loan application shall be prepared by the affected local government and be approved by the GAR. FEMA has determined that a local government, in applying for a loan as a result of having suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenue as a result of a major disaster, is not required to first seek credit elsewhere (see § 206.367(c)).
</P>
<P>(2) The State exercises administrative authority over the local government's application. The State's review should include a determination that the applicant is legally qualified, under State law, to assume the proposed debt, and may include an overall review for accuracy for the submission. The Governor's Authorized Representative may request the Regional Administrator to waive the requirement for a State review if an otherwise eligible applicant is not subject to State administration authority and the State cannot legally participate in the loan application process.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Financial requirements.</I> (1) The loan application shall be developed from financial information contained in the local government's annual operating budget (see § 206.364(b)(2)) and shall include a Summary of Revenue Loss and Unreimbursed Disaster-Related Expenses, a Statement of the Applicant's Operating Results—Cash Position, a Debt History, Tax Assessment Data, Financial Projections, Other Information, a Certification, and the Assurances listed on the application.
</P>
<P>(i) Copies of the local government's financial reports (Revenue and Expense and Balance Sheet) for the 3 fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year of the disaster and the applicant's most recent financial statement must accompany the application. The local government's financial reports to be submitted are those annual (or interim) consolidated and/or individual official annual financial presentations for the General Fund and all other funds maintained by the local government.
</P>
<P>(ii) Each application for a Community Disaster Loan must also include:
</P>
<P>(A) A statement by the local government identifying each fund (i.e. General Fund, etc.) which is included as its annual Operating budget, and
</P>
<P>(B) A copy of the pertinent State statutes, ordinance, or regulations which prescribe the local government's system of budgeting, accounting and financial reporting, including a description of each fund account.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Operating budget.</I> For loan application purposes, the operating budget is that document or documents approved by an appropriating body, which contains an estimate of proposed expenditures, other than capital outlays for fixed assets for a stated period of time, and the proposed means of financing the expenditures. For loan cancellation purposes, FEMA interprets the term “operating budget” to mean actual revenues and expenditures of the local government as published in the official financial statements of the local government.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Operating budget increases.</I> Budget increases due to increases in the level of, or additions to, municipal services not rendered at the time of the disaster or not directly related to the disaster shall be identified.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Revenue and assessment information.</I> The applicant shall provide information concerning its method of tax assessment including assessment dates and the dates payments are due. Tax revenues assessed but not collected, or other revenues which the local government chooses to forgive, stay, or otherwise not exercise the right to collect, are not a legitimate revenue loss for purposes of evaluating the loan application.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Estimated disaster-related expense.</I> Unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character should be estimated. These are discussed in § 206.366(b).
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Federal review.</I> (1) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee shall approve a community disaster loan to the extent it is determined that the local government has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues and demonstrates a need for financial assistance to perform its governmental function as the result of the disaster.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Resubmission of application.</I> If a loan application is disapproved, in whole or in part, by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate because of inadequacy of information, a revised application may be resubmitted by the local government within sixty days of the date of the disapproval. Decision by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate on the resubmission is final.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Community disaster loan.</I> (1) The loan shall not exceed the lesser of:
</P>
<P>(i) The amount of projected revenue loss plus the projected unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character for the fiscal year of the major disaster and the subsequent 3 fiscal years, or
</P>
<P>(ii) 25 percent of the local government's annual operating budget for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Promissory note.</I> (i) Upon approval of the loan by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee, he or she, or a designated Loan Officer will execute a Promissory Note with the applicant. The Note must be co-signed by the State (see § 206.364(d)(2)(ii)). The applicant should indicate its funding requirements on the Schedule of Loan Increments on the Note.
</P>
<P>(ii) If the State cannot legally cosign the Promissory Note, the local government must pledge collateral security, acceptable to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, to cover the principal amount of the Note. The pledge should be in the form of a resolution by the local governing body identifying the collateral security.

<P>(a) <I>Funding.</I> (1) FEMA will disburse funds to the local government when requested, generally in accordance with the Schedule of Loan Increments in the Promissory Note. As funds are disbursed, interest will accrue against each disbursement.
</P>
<P>(2) When each incremental disbursement is requested, the local government shall submit a copy of its most recent financial report (if not submitted previously) for consideration by FEMA in determining whether the level and frequency of periodic payments continue to be justified. The local government shall also provide the latest available data on anticipated and actual tax and other revenue collections. Desired adjustments in the disbursement schedule shall be submitted in writing at least 10 days prior to the proposed disbursement date in order to ensure timely receipt of the funds. A sinking fund should be established to amortize the debt.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Financial management.</I> (1) Each local government with an approved Community Disaster Loan shall establish necessary accounting records, consistent with local government's financial management system, to account for loan funds received and disbursed and to provide an audit trail.
</P>
<P>(2) FEMA auditors, State auditors, the GAR, the Regional Administrator, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, and the Comptroller General of the United States or their duly authorized representatives shall, for the purpose of audits and examination, have access to any books, documents, papers, and records that pertain to Federal funds, equipments, and supplies received under these regulations.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Loan servicing.</I> (1) The applicant annually shall submit to FEMA copies of its annual financial reports (operating statements, balance sheets, etc.) for the fiscal year of the major disaster, and for each of the 3 subsequent fiscal years.
</P>
<P>(2) The Disaster Assistance Directorate, will review the loan periodically. The purpose of the reevaluation is to determine whether projected revenue losses, disaster-related expenses, operating budgets, and other factors have changed sufficiently to warrant adjustment of the scheduled disbursement of the loan proceeds.
</P>
<P>(3) The Disaster Assistance Directorate, shall provide each loan recipient with a loan status report on a quarterly basis. The recipient will notify FEMA of any changes of the responsible municipal official who executed the Promissory Note.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Inactive loans.</I> If no funds have been disbursed from the Treasury, and if the local government does not anticipate a need for such funds, the note may be cancelled at any time upon a written request through the State and Regional Office to FEMA.

<HEAD>§ 206.366   Loan cancellation.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Policies.</I> (1) FEMA shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Community Disaster Loan to the extent that the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines that revenues of the local government during the full three fiscal year period following the disaster are insufficient, as a result of the disaster, to meet the operating budget for the local government, including additional unreimbursed disaster-related expenses for a municipal operating character. For loan cancellation purposes, FEMA interprets that term <I>operating budget</I> to mean actual revenues and expenditures of the local government as published in the official financial statements of the local government.
</P>
<P>(2) If the tax and other revenues rates or the tax assessment valuation of property which was not damaged or destroyed by the disaster are reduced during the 3 fiscal years subsequent to the major disaster, the tax and other revenue rates and tax assessment valuation factors applicable to such property in effect at the time of the major disaster shall be used without reduction for purposes of computing revenues received. This may result in decreasing the potential for loan cancellations.
</P>
<P>(3) If the local government's fiscal year is changed during the “full 3 year period following the disaster” the actual period will be modified so that the required financial data submitted covers an inclusive 36-month period.
</P>
<P>(4) If the local government transfers funds from its operating funds accounts to its capital funds account, utilizes operating funds for other than routine maintenance purposes, or significantly increases expenditures which are not disaster related, except increases due to inflation, the annual operating budget or operating statement expenditures will be reduced accordingly for purposes of evaluating any request for loan cancellation.
</P>
<P>(5) It is not the purpose of this loan program to underwrite predisaster budget or actual deficits of the local government. Consequently, such deficits carried forward will reduce any amounts otherwise eligible for loan cancellation.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Disaster-related expenses of a municipal operation character.</I> (1) For purpose of this loan, unreimbursed expenses of a municipal operating character are those incurred for general government purposes, such as police and fire protection, trash collection, collection of revenues, maintenance of public facilities, flood and other hazard insurance, and other expenses normally budgeted for the general fund, as defined by the Municipal Finance Officers Association.
</P>
<P>(2) Disaster-related expenses do not include expenditures associated with debt service, any major repairs, rebuilding, replacement or reconstruction of public facilities or other capital projects, intragovernmental services, special assessments, and trust and agency fund operations. Disaster expenses which are eligible for reimbursement under project applications or other Federal programs are not eligible for loan cancellation.
</P>
<P>(3) Each applicant shall maintain records including documentation necessary to identify expenditures for unreimbursed disaster-related expenses. Examples of such expenses include but are not limited to:
</P>
<P>(i) Interest paid on money borrowed to pay amounts FEMA does not advance toward completion of approved Project Applications.
</P>
<P>(ii) Unreimbursed costs to local governments for providing usable sites with utilities for mobile homes used to meet disaster temporary housing requirements.
</P>
<P>(iii) Unreimbursed costs required for police and fire protection and other community services for mobile home parks established as the result of or for use following a disaster.
</P>
<P>(iv) The cost to the applicant of flood insurance required under Public Law 93-234, as amended, and other hazard insurance required under section 311, Public Law 93-288, as amended, as a condition of Federal disaster assistance for the disaster under which the loan is authorized.
</P>
<P>(4) The following expenses are not considered to be disaster-related for Community Disaster Loan purposes:
</P>
<P>(i) The local government's share for assistance provided under the Act including flexible funding under section 406(c)(1) of the Act.
</P>
<P>(ii) Improvements related to the repair or restoration of disaster public facilities approved on Project Applications.
</P>
<P>(iii) Otherwise eligible costs for which no Federal reimbursement is requested as a part of the applicant's disaster response commitment, or cost sharing as specified in the FEMA-State Agreement for the disaster.
</P>
<P>(iv) Expenses incurred by the local government which are reimbursed on the applicant's project application.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Cancellation application.</I> A local government which has drawn loan funds from the Treasury may request cancellation of the principal and related interest by submitting an Application for Loan Cancellation through the Governor's Authorized Representative to the Regional Administrator prior to the expiration date of the loan.
</P>
<P>(1) Financial information submitted with the application shall include the following:
</P>
<P>(i) Annual Operating Budgets for the fiscal year of the disaster and the 3 subsequent fiscal years;
</P>
<P>(ii) Annual Financial Reports (Revenue and Expense and Balance Sheet) for each of the above fiscal years. Such financial records must include copies of the local government's annual financial reports, including operating statements balance sheets and related consolidated and individual presentations for each fund account. In addition, the local government must include an explanatory statement when figures in the Application for Loan Cancellation form differ from those in the supporting financial reports.
</P>
<P>(iii) The following additional information concerning annual real estate property taxes pertaining to the community for each of the above fiscal years:
</P>
<P>(A) The market value of the tax base (dollars);
</P>
<P>(B) The assessment ratio (percent);
</P>
<P>(C) The assessed valuation (dollars);
</P>
<P>(D) The tax levy rate (mils);
</P>
<P>(E) Taxes levied and collected (dollars).
</P>
<P>(iv) Audit reports for each of the above fiscal years certifying to the validity of the Operating Statements. The financial statements of the local government shall be examined in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by independent certified public accountants. The report should not include recommendations concerning loan cancellation or repayment.
</P>
<P>(v) Other financial information specified in the Application for Loan Cancellation.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Narrative justification.</I> The application may include a narrative presentation to amplify the financial material accompanying the application and to present any extenuating circumstances which the local government wants the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate to consider in rendering a decision on the cancellation request.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Determination.</I> (1) If, based on a review of the Application for Loan Cancellation and FEMA audit, when determined necessary, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate determines that all or part of the Community Disaster Loan funds should be canceled, the principal amount which is canceled will become a grant, and the related interest will be forgiven. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate's determination concerning loan cancellation will specify that any uncancelled principal and related interest must be repaid immediately and that, if immediate repayment will constitute a financial hardship, the local government must submit for FEMA review and approval, a repayment schedule for settling the indebtedness on timely basis. Such repayments must be made to the Treasurer of the United States and be sent to FEMA, Attention: Chief Financial Officer.
</P>
<P>(2) A loan or cancellation of a loan does not reduce or affect other disaster-related grants or other disaster assistance. However, no cancellation may be made that would result in a duplication of benefits to the applicant.
</P>
<P>(3) The uncancelled portion of the loan must be repaid in accordance with § 206.367.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Appeals.</I> If an Application for Loan Cancellation is disapproved, in whole or in part, by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee, the local government may submit any additional information in support of the application within 60 days of the date of disapproval. The decision by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee on the submission is final.

<P>(a) <I>General.</I> The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may make a Special Community Disaster Loan to any local government which has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster and which demonstrates a need for Federal financial assistance in order to provide essential services.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Amount of loan.</I> The amount of the loan is based upon need, not to exceed 25 percent of the operating budget of the local government for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurs. The term fiscal year as used in this subpart means the local government's fiscal year.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Interest rate.</I> The interest rate is the rate for five year maturities as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in effect on the date that the Promissory Note is executed. This rate is from the monthly Treasury schedule of certified interest rates which takes into consideration the current average yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States. If an applicant can demonstrate <I>unusual circumstances involving financial hardship</I>, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may approve a rate equal to the five year maturity rate plus 1 per centum, adjusted to the nearest

However, when extenuating circumstances exist and the recipient demonstrates an inability to repay the loan within the initial 10 years, but agrees to repay such loan over an extended period of time, additional time may be provided for loan repayment (see § 206.377(c)).
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Use of loan funds.</I> The local government shall use the loaned funds to assist in providing essential services. The funds shall not be used to finance capital improvements nor the repair or restoration of damaged public facilities. Neither the loan nor any cancelled portion of the loans may be used as the non-Federal share of any Federal program, including those under the Stafford Act.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Relation to other assistance.</I> Any Special Community Disaster Loans including cancellations of loans made under this subpart shall not reduce or otherwise affect any commitments, grants, or other assistance provided under the authority of the Stafford Act or this part.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Cancellation.</I> The Director of the Public Assistance Division shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Special Community Disaster Loan to the extent that he/she determines that revenues of the local government during the three full fiscal years following the disaster are insufficient to meet the operating budget of that local government because of disaster-related revenue losses and additional unreimbursed disaster-related municipal operating expenses.

<HEAD>§ 206.373   Eligibility criteria.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Local government.</I> (1) The local government must be located within the area eligible for assistance under a major disaster declaration. In addition, State law must not prohibit the local government from incurring the indebtedness resulting from a Federal loan.
</P>
<P>(2) Criteria considered by FEMA in determining the eligibility of a local government for a Special Community Disaster Loan include the loss of tax and other revenues as result of a major disaster, a demonstrated need for financial assistance in order to perform essential governmental functions, the maintenance of an annual operating budget, and the responsibility to provide essential services to the community. Eligibility for other assistance under the Stafford Act does not, by itself, establish entitlement to such a loan.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Loan eligibility</I>—(1) <I>General.</I> To be eligible, the local government must show that it may suffer or has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues as a result of a major disaster or emergency, and it must demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to provide essential municipal services. Loan eligibility is based on the financial condition of the local government and a review of financial information and supporting documentation accompanying the application.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Substantial loss of tax and other revenues.</I> The fiscal year of the disaster or the succeeding fiscal year is the base period for determining whether a local government may suffer or has suffered a substantial loss of revenue. Criteria used in determining whether a local government has or may suffer a substantial loss of tax and other revenue include the following disaster-related factors:
</P>
<P>(i) Whether the disaster caused a large enough reduction in cash receipts from normal revenue sources, excluding borrowing, which affects significantly and adversely the level and/or categories of essential services provided prior to the disaster;
</P>
<P>(ii) Whether the disaster caused a revenue loss of over 5 percent of total revenue estimated for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred or for the succeeding fiscal year.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Demonstrated need for financial assistance.</I> The local government must demonstrate a need for financial assistance in order to perform essential governmental functions. The criteria used in making this determination may include some or all of the following factors:
</P>
<P>(i) Whether there are sufficient funds to meet current fiscal year operating requirements;
</P>
<P>(ii) Whether there is availability of cash or other liquid assets from the prior fiscal year;
</P>
<P>(iii) Current financial condition considering projected expenditures for governmental services and availability of other financial resources;
</P>
<P>(iv) Ability to obtain financial assistance or needed revenue from State and other Federal agencies for direct program expenditures;
</P>
<P>(v) Debt ratio (relationship of annual receipts to debt service);
</P>
<P>(vi) Displacement of revenue-producing business due to property destruction;
</P>
<P>(vii) Necessity to reduce or eliminate essential services; and
</P>
<P>(viii) Danger of municipal insolvency.

<HEAD>§ 206.374   Loan application.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Application.</I> (1) The local government shall submit an application for a Special Community Disaster Loan through the GAR. The loan must be justified on the basis of need and shall be based on the actual and projected expenses, as a result of the disaster, for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred and for the 3 succeeding fiscal years. The loan application shall be prepared by the affected local government and be approved by the GAR. FEMA has determined that a local government, in applying for a loan as a result of having suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenue as a result of a major disaster, is not required to first seek credit elsewhere (see § 206.377(c)).
</P>
<P>(2) The State exercises administrative authority over the local government's application. The State's review should include a determination that the applicant is legally qualified, under State law, to assume the proposed debt, and may include an overall review for accuracy of the submission. The GAR may request the Regional Administrator to waive the requirement for a State review if an otherwise eligible applicant is not subject to State administration authority and the State cannot legally participate in the loan application process.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Financial requirements.</I> (1) The loan application shall be developed from financial information contained in the local government's annual operating budget (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section) and shall include a Summary of Revenue Loss and Unreimbursed Disaster-Related Expenses, a Statement of the Applicant's Operating Results—Cash Position, and certification and assurances requested by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.
</P>
<P>(i) Copies of the local government's financial reports (Revenue and Expense and Balance Sheet) for the 3 fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year of the disaster and the applicant's most recent financial statement must, unless impracticable, accompany the application. The local government's financial reports to be submitted are those annual (or interim) consolidated and/or individual official annual financial presentations for the General Fund and all other funds maintained by the local government.
</P>
<P>(ii) Each application for a Special Community Disaster Loan must also include:
</P>
<P>(A) A statement by the local government identifying each fund (i.e. General Fund, etc.) which is included as its annual Operating budget, and
</P>
<P>(B) A copy of the pertinent State statutes, ordinances, or regulations which prescribe the local government's system of budgeting, accounting and financial reporting, including a description of each fund account.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Operating budget.</I> For loan application purposes, the operating budget is that document or documents approved by an appropriating body, which contains an estimate of proposed expenditures, other than capital outlays for fixed assets for a stated period of time, and the proposed means of financing the expenditures. For loan cancellation purposes, FEMA interprets the term “operating budget” to mean actual revenues and expenditures of the local government as published in the official financial statements of the local government.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Operating budget increases.</I> Budget increases due to increases in the level of, or additions to, municipal services not rendered at the time of the disaster or not directly related to the disaster shall be identified.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Revenue and assessment information.</I> The applicant shall provide information concerning its method of tax assessment including assessment dates and the dates payments are due.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Estimated disaster-related expense.</I> Unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character should be estimated.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Federal review.</I> (1) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee shall approve a Special Community Disaster Loan to the extent it is determined that the local government has suffered a substantial loss of tax and other revenues and demonstrates a need for financial assistance as the result of the disaster to provide essential municipal services.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Resubmission of application.</I> If a loan application is disapproved, in whole or in part, by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate because of inadequacy of information, a revised application may be submitted by the local government within sixty days of the date of the disapproval. Decision by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate on the resubmission is final.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Special Community Disaster Loan.</I> (1) The loan shall not exceed the lesser of:
</P>
<P>(i) The amount of projected revenue loss plus the projected unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character for the fiscal year of the major disaster and the subsequent 3 fiscal years, or
</P>
<P>(ii) 25 percent of the local government's annual operating budget for the fiscal year in which the disaster occurred.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Promissory note.</I> (i) Upon approval of the loan by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate or designee, he or she, or a designated Loan Officer will execute a Promissory Note with the applicant. The Note must be co-signed by the State (see paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section). The applicant should indicate its funding requirements on the Schedule of Loan Increments on the Note.
</P>
<P>(ii) If the State cannot legally cosign the Promissory Note, the local government must pledge collateral security, acceptable to the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, to cover the principal amount of the Note. The pledge should be in the form of a resolution by the local governing body identifying the collateral security.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Waiver of requirements.</I> Notwithstanding any other provision of this or other sections promulgated pursuant to Public Law 109-88, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may, upon the request of an applicant or loan recipient, waive any specific application requirement or financial reporting requirement (see, e.g., § 206.375(a)(2)) upon a finding by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate that the effects of the major disaster prevent the applicant from fulfilling the application requirement and that waiving the requirements would be consistent with the purposes of the Community Disaster Loan Act of 2005.

<P>(2) When each incremental disbursement is requested, the local government shall submit a copy of its most recent financial report (if not submitted previously) for consideration by FEMA in determining whether the level and frequency of periodic payments continue to be justified. The local government shall also provide the latest available data on anticipated and actual tax and other revenue collections.

<HEAD>§ 206.376   Loan cancellation.</HEAD>
<P>(a) FEMA shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Special Community Disaster Loan to the extent that the Director of the Public Assistance Division determines that revenues of the local government during the three-full-fiscal-year period following the disaster are insufficient, as a result of the disaster, to meet the operating budget for the local government, including additional unreimbursed disaster-related expenses of a municipal operating character.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Definitions.</I> For loan cancellation purposes,
</P>
<P>(1) “Operating budget” means actual revenues and expenditures of the local government as published in the official financial statements of the local government.
</P>
<P>(2) “Revenue” means any source of income from taxes, fees, fines, and other sources of income, and will be recognized only as they become susceptible to accrual (measurable and available).
</P>
<P>(3) “Three-full-fiscal-year period following the disaster” means either a 36-month period beginning on September 1, 2005, or the 36 months of the applicant's fiscal year as established before the disaster, at the applicant's discretion.
</P>
<P>(4) “Operating expenses” means those expenses and expenditures incurred as a result of performing services, including salaries and benefits, contractual services, and commodities. Capital expenditures and debt service payments and capital leases are not considered operating expenses. Under accrual accounting, expenses are recognized as soon as a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Revenue Calculation procedures.</I> (1) If the tax rates and other revenues or the tax assessment valuation of property which was not damaged or destroyed by the disaster are reduced during the three full fiscal years subsequent to the major disaster, the tax rates and other revenues and tax assessment valuation factors applicable to such property in effect at the time of the major disaster shall be used without reduction for purposes of computing revenues received.
</P>
<P>(2) At the applicant's discretion, the three-full-fiscal-year period following the disaster is either a 36-month period beginning on September 1, 2005 or the 36 months of the applicant's fiscal year as established before the disaster. If the applicant's fiscal year is changed within the 36 months immediately following the disaster, the actual period will be modified so that the required financial data submitted covers an inclusive 36-month period. Should the applicant elect the 36-month period beginning September 1, 2005, FEMA will prorate the revenues and expenses for the partial years based on the applicant's annual financial statements.
</P>
<P>(3) If the local government transfers funds from its operating funds accounts to its capital funds account, utilizes operating funds for other than routine maintenance purposes, or significantly increases expenditures which are not disaster related, except increases due to inflation, the annual operating budget or operating statement expenditures will be reduced accordingly for purposes of evaluating any request for loan cancellation.
</P>
<P>(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the amount of property taxes that are transferred to other funds for Debt Service or Pension Obligations funding will not be excluded from the calculation of the operating budget or from expenditures in calculation of the operating deficit, to the extent that the property tax revenues in the General Fund are less than they were pre-disaster. FEMA will consider the impact of the loss of property tax revenue in Debt Service or Pension Funds (non-operating funds) if all of the following conditions are met:
</P>
<P>(i) The entity experienced a loss of property tax revenue as a result of the disaster and the assessed value during the three years following the disaster, in the aggregate, is less than the pre-disaster assessed value;
</P>
<P>(ii) the entity has a property tax cap limitation on the ability to raise property taxes post-disaster; and
</P>
<P>(iii) the property taxes are levied through the General Operating Fund and transfers for obligations mandated by law are made to fund Debt Service or Pension Obligations which result in the entity experiencing a reduction of property tax revenues in the General Fund.
</P>
<P>(5) It is not the purpose of this loan program to underwrite pre-disaster budget or actual deficits of the local government. Consequently, such deficits carried forward will reduce any amounts otherwise eligible for loan cancellation.
</P>
<P>(6) The provisions of this section apply to all Special Community Disaster loans issued from the dates of enactment of Public Law 109-88 and Public Law 109-234.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Disaster-related expenses of a municipal operation character.</I> (1) For purposes of this loan, unreimbursed expenses of a municipal operating character are those incurred for general government purposes, including but not limited to police and fire protection, trash collection, collection of revenues, maintenance of public facilities, flood and other hazard insurance.
</P>
<P>(2) Disaster-related expenses do not include expenditures associated with debt service, any major repairs, rebuilding, replacement or reconstruction of public facilities or other capital projects, intragovernmental services, special assessments, and trust and agency fund operations. Disaster expenses which are eligible for reimbursement under project applications or other Federal programs are not eligible for loan cancellation.
</P>
<P>(3) Each applicant shall maintain records including documentation necessary to identify expenditures for unreimbursed disaster-related expenses. Examples of such expenses include but are not limited to:
</P>
<P>(i) Interest paid on money borrowed to pay amounts FEMA does not advance toward completion of approved Project Applications.
</P>
<P>(ii) Unreimbursed costs to local governments for providing usable sites with utilities for mobile homes used to meet disaster temporary housing requirements.
</P>
<P>(iii) Unreimbursed costs required for police and fire protection and other community services for mobile home parks established as the result of or for use following a disaster.
</P>
<P>(iv) The cost to the applicant of flood insurance required under Public Law 93-234, as amended, and other hazard insurance required under section 311, Public Law 93-288, as amended, as a condition of Federal disaster assistance for the disaster under which the loan is authorized.
</P>
<P>(4) The following expenses are not considered to be disaster-related for Special Community Disaster Loan purposes:
</P>
<P>(i) The local government's share for assistance provided under the Stafford Act including flexible funding under section 406(c)(1) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 5172).
</P>
<P>(ii) Improvements related to the repair or restoration of disaster public facilities approved on Project Applications.
</P>
<P>(iii) Otherwise eligible costs for which no Federal reimbursement is requested as a part of the applicant's disaster response commitment, or cost sharing as specified in the FEMA-State Agreement for the disaster.
</P>
<P>(iv) Expenses incurred by the local government which are reimbursed on the applicant's Project Application.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Cancellation application.</I> A local government which has drawn loan funds from the U.S. Treasury may request cancellation of the principal and related interest by submitting an Application for Loan Cancellation through the Governor's Authorized Representative to the Regional Administrator prior to the expiration date of the loan.
</P>
<P>(1) Financial information submitted with the application shall include the following:
</P>
<P>(i) Annual Operating Budgets for the fiscal year of the disaster and the three subsequent fiscal years;
</P>
<P>(ii) Annual Financial Reports (Revenue and Expense and Balance Sheet) for each of the above fiscal years. Such financial records must include copies of the local government's annual financial reports, including operating statements and balance sheets and related consolidated and individual presentations for each fund account. In addition, the local government must include an explanatory statement when figures in the Application for Loan Cancellation form differ from those in the supporting financial reports.
</P>
<P>(iii) The following additional information concerning annual real estate property taxes pertaining to the community for each of the above fiscal years:
</P>
<P>(A) The market value of the tax base (dollars);
</P>
<P>(B) The assessment ratio (percent);
</P>
<P>(C) The assessed valuation (dollars);
</P>
<P>(D) The tax levy rate (mils);
</P>
<P>(E) Taxes levied and collected (dollars).
</P>
<P>(iv) Audit reports for each of the above fiscal years certifying to the validity of the Operating Statements. The financial statements of the local government shall be examined in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by independent certified public accountants. The report should not include recommendations concerning loan cancellation or repayment.
</P>
<P>(v) Other financial information specified in the Application for Loan Cancellation.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Narrative justification.</I> The application may include a narrative presentation to supplement the financial material accompanying the application and to present any extenuating circumstances which the local government wants the Director of the Public Assistance Division to consider in rendering a decision on the cancellation request.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Determination.</I> (1) The Director of the Public Assistance Division will make a cancellation determination within 60 days of the date the applicant submits all required and requested information, including documentation in support of un-reimbursed disaster related expenses.
</P>
<P>(2) If, based on a review of the Application for Loan Cancellation and FEMA audit, the Director of the Public Assistance Division determines that all or part of the Special Community Disaster Loan funds should be canceled, the amount of principal canceled and the related interest will be forgiven. The Director of the Public Assistance Division's determination concerning loan cancellation will specify that any uncancelled principal and related interest must be repaid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note, and that, if repayment will constitute a financial hardship, the local government must submit for FEMA review and approval, a repayment schedule for settling the indebtedness on a timely basis. Such repayments must be made to the Treasurer of the United States and be sent to FEMA, Attention: Office of the Chief Financial Officer.
</P>
<P>(3) A loan or cancellation of a loan does not reduce or affect other disaster-related grants or other disaster assistance. However, no cancellation may be made that would result in a duplication of benefits to the applicant.
</P>
<P>(4) The uncancelled portion of the loan must be repaid in accordance with § 206.377.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Appeals.</I> If an Application for Loan Cancellation is disapproved, in whole or in part, by the Director of the Public Assistance Division, the local government may submit any additional information in support of the application within 60 days of the date of disapproval. The decision by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate on the additional information is final.

<P>(a) <I>Prepayments.</I> The local government may make prepayments against loan at any time without any prepayment penalty.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Repayment.</I> To the extent not otherwise cancelled, loan funds become due and payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note. The note shall include the following provisions:
</P>
<P>(1) The term of a loan made under this program is 5 years, unless extended by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. Interest will accrue on outstanding cash from the actual date of its disbursement by FEMA or FEMA's designated Disbursing Agency.
</P>
<P>(2) The interest amount due will be computed separately for each Treasury disbursement as follows: I = P X R X T, where I = the amount of simple interest, P = the principal amount disbursed; R = the interest rate of the loan; and, T = the outstanding term in years from the date of disbursement to date of repayment, with periods less than 1 year computed on the basis of 365 days/year. If any portion of the loan is cancelled, the interest amount due will be computed on the remaining principal with the shortest outstanding term.
</P>
<P>(3) Each payment made against the loan will be applied first to the interest computed to the date of the payment, and then to the principal. Prepayments of scheduled installments, or any portion thereof, may be made at any time and shall be applied to the installments last to become due under the loan and shall not affect the obligation of the borrower to pay the remaining installments.
</P>
<P>(4) The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may defer payments of principal and interest until FEMA makes its final determination with respect to any Application for Loan Cancellation which the borrower may submit. However, interest will continue to accrue.
</P>
<P>(5) Any costs incurred by the Federal Government in collecting the note shall be added to the unpaid balance of the loan, bear interest at the same rate as the loan, and be immediately due without demand.
</P>
<P>(6) In the event of default on this note by the borrower, the FEMA claims collection officer will take action to recover the outstanding principal plus related interest under Federal debt collection authorities, including administrative offset against other Federal funds due the borrower and/or referral to the Department of Justice for judicial enforcement and collection.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Additional time.</I> In unusual circumstances involving financial hardship, the local government may request an additional period of time beyond the original 10 year term to repay the indebtedness. Such request may be approved by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate subject to the following conditions:
</P>
<P>(1) The local government must submit documented evidence that it has applied for the same credit elsewhere and that such credit is not available at a rate equivalent to the current Treasury rate.
</P>
<P>(2) The principal amount shall be the original uncancelled principal plus related interest less any payments made.
</P>
<P>(3) The interest rate shall be the Treasury rate in effect at the time the new Promissory Note is executed but in no case less than the original interest rate. A reduced rate may not be applied if was it was not previously applied to the loan.
</P>
<P>(4) The term of the new Promissory Note shall be for the settlement period requested by the local government but not greater than 10 years from the date the new note is executed.

<HEAD>§ 206.432   Federal grant assistance.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> This section describes the extent of Federal funding available under the State's grant, as well as limitations and special procedures applicable to each.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Amounts of assistance.</I> The total Federal contribution of funds is based on the estimated aggregate grant amount to be made under the Stafford Act for the major disaster (less associated administrative costs), and must be as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Standard percentages.</I> Not to exceed 15 percent for the first $2,000,000,000 or less of such amounts; not to exceed 10 percent of the portion of such amounts over $2,000,000,000 and not more than $10,000,000,000; and not to exceed 7.5 percent of the portion of such amounts over $10,000,000,000 and not more than $35,333,000,000.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Twenty (20) percent.</I> A State with an approved Enhanced State Mitigation Plan, in effect before the disaster declaration, which meets the requirements outlined in § 201.5 of this subchapter will be eligible for assistance under the HMGP not to exceed 20 percent of such amounts, for amounts not more than $35.333 billion.
</P>
<P>(3) The estimates of Federal assistance under this paragraph (b) will be based on the Regional Administrator's estimate of all eligible costs, actual grants, and appropriate mission assignments.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Cost sharing.</I> All mitigation measures approved under the State's grant will be subject to the cost sharing provisions established in the FEMA-State Agreement. FEMA may contribute up to 75 percent of the cost of measures approved for funding under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program for major disasters declared on or after June 10, 1993. The non-Federal share may exceed the Federal share. FEMA will not contribute to costs above the Federally approved estimate.

<HEAD>§ 208.12   Maximum Pay Rate Table.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Purpose.</I> This section establishes the process for creating and updating the Maximum Pay Rate Table (Table), and the Table's use to reimburse Affiliated Personnel (Task Force Physicians, Task Force Engineers, and Canine Handlers) and Backfill for Activated System Members employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit Participating Agency. Section 208.32 defines the “Maximum Pay Rate Table” as “the DHS-issued table that identifies the maximum pay rates for selected System positions that may be used for reimbursement of Affiliated Personnel compensation and Backfill for Activated System Members employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit Participating Agency.” In that same section, the term “Affiliated Personnel” is defined as “individuals not normally employed by a Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency and individuals normally affiliated with a Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency as volunteers.” 
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Scope of this section.</I> (1) The Maximum Pay Rate Table applies to those individuals who are not normally employed by a Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency, or whose affiliation with a Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency is as a volunteer; that is, an individual whom the Sponsoring Agency or Participating Agency does not normally compensate in any way, at any rate. 
</P>
<P>(2) The Table also applies to Backfill for Activated System Members employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit Participating Agency. 
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Method for determining maximum pay rates.</I> (1) DHS uses the United States Office of Personnel Management's salary rates, computed under 5 U.S.C. 5504, as the basis for the maximum pay rate schedule. DHS considers System members' experience and sets maximum pay rates at the maximum grade, middle step for each position, which demonstrates an experience level of five years. 
</P>
<P>(2) The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) publishes salary and locality pay schedules each calendar year. 
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Physicians.</I> DHS uses the latest Special Salary Rate Table Number 0290 for Medical Officers (Clinical) Worldwide for physicians. The rates used in the initial Table can be found at <I>http://www.opm.gov/oca/03 tables/SSR/HTML/0290.asp.</I>
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Engineers and Canine Handlers.</I> DHS uses the latest General Schedule pay scale for both positions. Both specialties are compared to the General Schedule pay scale to ensure parity with like specialties on a task force (canine handlers are equated with rescue specialists). The rates used in the initial Table can be found at <I>http://www.opm.gov/oca/03tables/html/gs.asp.</I>
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Locality Pay.</I> To determine adjustments for locality pay DHS uses the latest locality pay areas (including the “Rest of U.S.” area) established by OPM. The rates used in the initial Table can be found at <I>http://www.opm.gov/oca/03tables/locdef.asp.</I>
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Review and update.</I> DHS will review and update the Table periodically, at least annually. The comments of Sponsoring and Participating Agencies and their experience with the Table will be considered and evaluated in the course of the reviews. 
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Initial rates and subsequent revisions.</I> DHS will publish the initial maximum pay rate table in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> as a notice with request for comments. Subsequent revisions will be made to the pay rate table as OPM changes salary rates as described in this section. When subsequent revisions are made to the maximum pay rate table DHS will publish the new maximum pay rate table in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The rates will be effective for the latest year indicated by OPM. 
<SU>1</SU>
<FTREF/> 
</P>
<FTNT>
<P>
<SU>1</SU> In some years the latest year may not be the current calendar year. For instance, OPM did not change its pay rates for calendar year 2004, and the 2003 schedules apply.</P></FTNT>
<P>(d) <I>Application of the maximum pay rate table</I>—(1) <I>Applicability.</I> The Maximum Pay Rate Table sets forth maximum rates for which DHS will reimburse the Sponsoring Agency for compensation paid to Activated Affiliated Personnel and as Backfill for Activated System Members employed by or otherwise associated with a for-profit Participating Agency. 
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Higher rates.</I> The Sponsoring Agency may choose to pay Affiliated Personnel at a higher rate, but DHS will not reimburse the increment above the maximum rate specified in the Maximum Pay Rate Table. Likewise, the Sponsoring Agency may choose to enter into a Participating Agency agreement with the individual's employer, rather than use the individual as an Affiliated Personnel, in which case the Maximum Pay Rate Table would not apply. 
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Compensation for Sponsoring Agency employees serving as Affiliated Personnel.</I> An employee of a Sponsoring Agency serving on a Task Force in a capacity other than his or her normal job, <I>e.g.</I>, a fire department dispatcher affiliated with the Task Force as a canine search specialist, as an Affiliated Personnel, would not necessarily be subject to the Maximum Pay Rate Table for reimbursement for salary and benefits for that individual. However, Sponsoring Agencies may use the rates in the Maximum Pay Rate Table as a guide for establishing compensation levels for such individuals. 
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Backfill expenses for Affiliated Personnel under § 208.39(g).</I> (i) The only way that DHS can reimburse for Backfill costs incurred for Affiliated Personnel is through Participating Agencies. If reimbursement for Backfill expenses is needed for Affiliated Personnel, DHS encourages them to urge their employers or professional association to seek Participating Agency status. 
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Private, for-profit organizations.</I> Participating Agency status is available to private, for-profit organizations, <I>e.g.</I>, HMOs or medical or engineering professional associations, under the revised definition of “Participating Agency” set forth in this Interim rule. (See Definitions, § 208.2, <I>Participating Agency.</I> and § 208.32, <I>Maximum Pay Rate Tabl.e</I>). When a for-profit Participating Agency must backfill an Activated System Member's position we will compensate that Participating Agency up to the maximum rate provided in the Table.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Compensation costs.</I> DHS will reimburse for-profit organizations, for purposes of reimbursement and Backfill, for the System Member's actual compensation or the actual compensation of the individual who Backfills a position (which includes salary and benefits, as described in §§ 208.39 and 208.40), but will not reimburse for billable or other rates that might be charged for services rendered to commercial clients or patients.

<P>Subgrantees must enter into an agreement with the State, with the written concurrence of the Regional Administrator, that provides the following assurances:
</P>
<P>(a) The subgrantee will administer the grant and implement the project in accordance with program requirements, 44 CFR part 13, the grant agreement, and with applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>(b) The State and subgrantee will administer the grant in an equitable and impartial manner, without discrimination on the grounds or race, color, religion nationality, sex, age, or economic status in compliance with section 308 of the Stafford Act (42 U.S.C. 5151) and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. In implementing the grant, the State and the subgrantee will ensure that no discrimination is practiced.
</P>
<P>(c) The State and subgrantee will ensure that projects involving alterations to existing structures comply with all applicable State and local codes.
</P>
<P>(d) The State and subgrantee will ensure that projects comply with applicable State and local floodplain management requirements. Structures will be elevated to the Base Flood Elevation.
</P>
<P>(e) Property owners participating in acquisition projects may receive assistance up to the pre-event fair market value of their real property, except as limited by the eligibility criteria.
</P>
<P>(f) The subgrantee will establish a process, which we must approve, whereby property owners participating in acquisition projects may request a review of the appraisal for their property, or request a second appraisal.
</P>
<P>(g) The State will reduce buyout assistance by any duplication of benefits from other sources. Such benefits include, but are not limited to, payments made to the homeowner for repair assistance; insurance settlements; legal settlements; Small Business Administration loans; and any other payments made by any source to address the property loss unless the property owner can provide receipts showing that the benefits were used for their intended purpose to make repairs to the property.
</P>
<P>(h) Increased Cost of Compliance coverage benefits under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) may be used to match elevation or acquisition and relocation projects. Increased Cost of Compliance claims can only be used for NFIP-approved costs; these can then be applied to the project grant match. This coverage does not pay for property acquisition, but can pay demolition or structure relocation.
</P>
<P>(i) The following restrictive covenants must be conveyed in the deed to any property acquired, accepted, or from which structures are removed (“the property”):
</P>
<P>(1) The property must be dedicated and maintained in perpetuity for uses compatible with open space, recreational, or wetlands management practices; and
</P>
<P>(2) No new structure(s) will be built on the property except as indicated in this paragraph:
</P>
<P>(A) A public facility that is open on all sides and functionally related to a designated open space or recreational use;
</P>
<P>(B) A public rest room; or
</P>
<P>(C) A structure that is compatible with open space, recreational, or wetlands management usage and proper floodplain management policies and practices, which the Administrator of FEMA approves in writing before the construction of the structure begins.
</P>
<P>(D) In general, allowable open space, recreational, and wetland management uses include parks for outdoor recreational activities, nature reserves, cultivation, grazing, camping (except where adequate warning time is not available to allow evacuation), temporary storage in the open of wheeled vehicles that are easily movable (except mobile homes), unimproved, permeable parking lots and buffer zones. Allowable uses generally do not include walled buildings, flood reduction levees, highways or other uses that obstruct the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain.
</P>
<P>(3) After completing the acquisition project, no application for future disaster assistance will be made for any purpose with respect to the property to any Federal entity or source, and no Federal entity or source will provide such assistance, even for the allowable uses of the property described above.
</P>
<P>(4) Any structures built on the property according to paragraph (i)(2) of this section, must be: Located to minimize the potential for flood damage; floodproofed; or elevated to the Base Flood Elevation plus one foot of freeboard.
</P>
<P>(5) The subgrantee or other public property owner will seek the approval of the State grantee agency and our Regional Administrator before conveying any interest in the property to any other party. The subgrantee or other public entity or qualified private nonprofit organization must retain all development rights to the property. Our Regional Administrator will only approve the transfer of properties that meet the criteria identified in this paragraph.
</P>
<P>(6) In order to carry out tasks associated with monitoring, we, the subgrantee, or the State have the right to enter the parcel, with notice to the parcel owner, to ensure compliance with land use restrictions. Subgrantees may identify the open space nature of the property on local tax maps to assist with monitoring. Whether the subgrantee obtains full title or a conservation easement on the parcel, the State must work with subgrantees to ensure that the parcel owner maintains the property in accordance with land use restrictions. Specifically, the State may:
</P>
<P>(i) Monitor and inspect the parcel every two years and certify that the owner continues to use the inspected parcel for open space or agricultural purposes; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Take measures to bring a non-compliant parcel back into compliance within 60 days of notice.
</P>
<P>(7) Only as a last resort, we reserve the right to require the subgrantee to bring the property back into compliance and transfer the title and easement to a qualified third party for future maintenance.
</P>
<P>(8) Every 2 years on October 1st, the subgrantee will report to the State, certifying that the property continues to be maintained consistent with the provisions of the agreement. The State will report the certification to us.

<HEAD>§ 295.5   Overview of the claims process.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The CGFAA is intended to provide persons who suffered losses from the Cerro Grande Fire with a simple, expedited process to seek redress from the United States. This section provides a brief explanation of the claims process for claims other than subrogation claims. It is not intended to supersede the more specific regulations that follow and explain the claims process in greater detail. In order to obtain benefits under this legislation, a person must submit all Cerro Grande Fire related claims against the United States to FEMA. A person who elects to proceed under the CGFAA is barred from bringing a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act or filing a civil action against the United States for damages resulting from the Cerro Grande Fire. Judicial review of our decisions under the CGFAA is available. 
</P>
<P>(b) The first step in the process is to file a Notice of Loss with OCGFC. OCGFC will provide the Claimant with a written acknowledgement that the claim has been filed and the claim number. 
</P>
<P>(c) Shortly thereafter, a Claims Reviewer will contact the Claimant to review the claim. The Claims Reviewer will help the Claimant formulate a strategy for obtaining any necessary documentation or other support. This assistance does not relieve the Claimant of his or her responsibility for establishing all elements of the Loss and the compensatory damages that are sought, including that the Cerro Grande Fire caused the Loss. After the Claimant has had an opportunity to discuss the claim with the Claims Reviewer, a Proof of Loss will be presented to the Claimant for signature. After any necessary documentation has been obtained and the claim has been fully evaluated, the Claims Reviewer will submit a report to the Authorized Official. The Claims Reviewer is responsible for providing an objective evaluation of the claim to the Authorized Official. 
</P>
<P>(d) The Authorized Official will review the report and determine whether compensation is due to the Claimant. The Claimant will be notified in writing of the Authorized Official's Determination. If the Claimant is satisfied with the decision payment will be made after the Claimant returns a completed Release and Certification Form. If the Claimant is dissatisfied with the Authorized Official's Determination an Administrative Appeal may be filed with the Director of OCGFC. If the Claimant remains dissatisfied after the appeal is decided, the dispute may be resolved through binding arbitration or heard in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico.

<HEAD>§ 295.6   Partial payments.</HEAD>
<P>OCGFC, on its own initiative, or in response to a request by a Claimant, may make one or more partial payments on the claim. A partial payment can be made if OCGFC has a reasonable basis to estimate the Claimant's damages. Acceptance of a partial payment in no way affects a Claimant's ability to pursue an Administrative Appeal of the Authorized Official's Determination or to pursue other rights afforded by the CGFAA. Partial payment decisions cannot be appealed.

<P>An insurer or other third party with the rights of a subrogee, who has compensated an Injured Person for Cerro Grande Fire related losses, may file a Subrogation Notice of Loss under the CGFAA for the subrogated claim. An insurer or other third party with the rights of a subrogee may file a Subrogation Notice of Loss without regard to whether the Injured Party who received payment from the insurer or third party filed a Notice of Loss. A Subrogation Notice of Loss may not be filed until the insurer or other party with the rights of a subrogee has made all payments that it believes the Injured Person is entitled to receive for Cerro Grande Fire related losses under the terms of the insurance policy or other agreement between the insurer or other party with the rights of a subrogee and the Injured Person. By filing a Subrogation Notice of Loss for any subrogated claim, the insurer or third party elects the CGFAA as its exclusive remedy against the United States for all subrogated claims arising out of the Cerro Grande Fire. Subrogation claims must be made on a Subrogation Notice of Loss form furnished by OCGFC. FEMA will evaluate subrogation claims on their merits. FEMA may reimburse insurers and other third parties with the rights of a subrogee for reasonable payments made to an Injured Party on or before October 25, 2000, which exceeded or were not required by the terms of the insurance policy or other agreement creating a right of subrogation.

<HEAD>§ 295.21   Allowable compensation.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Allowable compensation.</I> The CGFAA provides for the payment of compensatory damages. Compensatory damages are “real, substantial and just money damages established by the Claimant in compensation for actual or real injury or loss.” In general, an Injured Person will be compensated for Losses to the same extent that the plaintiff in a successful tort action brought against a private party under the laws of the State of New Mexico would be compensated. In addition the CGFAA permits FEMA to compensate Injured Parties for certain categories of “loss of property,” “business loss,” and “financial loss,” which are enumerated in the CGFAA. Damages must be reasonable in amount. Claimants must take reasonable steps to mitigate (reduce) their damages, if possible, as required by New Mexico tort law. 
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Exclusions.</I> Except as otherwise provided in the CGFAA, a Claimant will not receive compensation for any injury or damage that is not compensable under the Federal Tort Claims Act and New Mexico law. Punitive damages, statutory damages under § 30-32-4 of the New Mexico Statutes Annotated (1978), interest on claims, attorney's fees and agents' fees incurred in prosecuting a claim under the CGFAA or an insurance policy, adjusting costs incurred by an insurer or other third party with the rights of a subrogee, and taxes that may be owed by a Claimant as a consequence of receiving an award are not recoverable from FEMA. The cost to a Claimant of prosecuting a claim under the CGFAA does not constitute compensatory damages and is not recoverable from FEMA, except as provided in § 295.31(b). 
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Damages arising in the future.</I> In the event that a lump sum payment is awarded to a Claimant for future damages the amount of the payment will be Discounted to Present Value.

Mitigation compensation made available under this section may not exceed fifteen percent of payments from all sources (i.e., CGFAA, insurance proceeds, FEMA assistance under the Stafford Act) for damage to the structure and lot. The Claimant must obtain all government permits, approvals and clearances required by applicable law, ordinance or regulation before constructing the mitigation measures. The mitigation measures must be reviewed by FEMA under applicable environmental and historic preservation laws. Claimants must construct the mitigation measures for which they have received compensation. 
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Reduction in the value of real property.</I> Compensatory damages may be awarded for reduction in the value of real property that a Claimant owned before the fire if: 
</P>

<P>(g) <I>Disaster recovery loans.</I> FEMA will reimburse Claimants awarded compensation under the CGFAA for interest paid on Small Business Administration disaster loans and similar loans obtained after May 4, 2000. Interest will be reimbursed for the period beginning on the date that the loan was taken out and ending on the date when the Claimant receives a compensation award (other than a partial payment). Claimants are required to use the proceeds of their compensation awards to repay Small Business Administration disaster loans. FEMA will cooperate with the Small Business Administration to formulate procedures for assuring that Claimants repay Small Business Administration disaster loans contemporaneously with the receipt of CGFAA compensation awards. 
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Mitigation.</I> FEMA may compensate Claimants for the cost of reasonable and cost-effective efforts incurred on or before August 28, 2003 to mitigate the heightened risks of wildfire, flood or other natural disaster resulting from the Cerro Grande Fire that are consistent with a OCGFC-approved Mitigation Compensation Plan. No more than 15% of the total amount appropriated by Congress for the payment of Cerro Grande fire related claims may be allocated for mitigation compensation under this subsection.

For each category of Subsistence Resources, the Claimant must elect to receive compensatory damages either for the increased cost of obtaining Subsistence Resources from lands not damaged by the Cerro Grande Fire or for the cost of procuring substitute resources in the cash economy. Long-term damage awards will be made in the form of lump sum cash payments to eligible Claimants. 
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Proof of subsistence use.</I> FEMA may consider evidence submitted by Claimants, Indian Tribes and other knowledgeable sources in determining the nature and extent of a Claimant's subsistence uses. 
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Duration of damages.</I> Compensatory damages for subsistence losses will be paid for the period between May 4, 2000 and the date when Subsistence Resources can reasonably be expected to return to the level of availability that existed before the Cerro Grande Fire.

Alternatively, FEMA may provide flood insurance to such Claimants directly through a group or blanket policy. 
</P>
<P>(k) <I>Out of pocket expenses for treatment of mental health conditions.</I> FEMA may reimburse an individual Claimant for reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred for treatment of a mental health condition rendered by a licensed mental health professional, which condition resulted from the Cerro Grande Fire and which could not be effectively addressed through no-cost crisis counseling services available in the community. FEMA will not reimburse for treatment rendered after December 31, 2001. 
</P>
<P>(l) <I>Donations.</I> FEMA will compensate individual or business Claimants in the counties of Los Alamos, Rio Arriba, Sandoval and Santa Fe (including those located on pueblos and Indian reservations) for the cost of merchandise, use of equipment or other non-personal services, directly or indirectly donated to survivors of the Cerro Grande Fire not later than June 19, 2000. Donations will be valued at cost. FEMA will also compensate businesses located in the counties of Los Alamos, Rio Arriba, Sandoval and Santa Fe (including those located on pueblos and Indian reservations) for discounts offered to fire survivors on goods and services not later than June 19, 2000 provided that actual revenues earned by the business during the period May 1-June 30, 2000 did not exceed reasonable projections for the period and the shortfall between actual revenues and reasonable projections resulted from the Cerro Grande Fire. Compensation will be the difference between the Claimant's established post-fire price for the good or service actually charged to the general public and the post-fire discounted price charged to fire survivors. 
</P>
<P>(m) <I>Duplication of benefits.</I> The CGFAA allows FEMA to compensate Injured Parties only if their damages have not been paid or will not be paid by insurance or a third party.

<HEAD>§ 295.30   Establishing losses and damages.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Burden of proof.</I> The burden of proving Losses and damages rests with the Claimant. A Claimant may submit for the Administrative Record a statement explaining why the Claimant believes that the Losses and damages are compensable and any documentary evidence supporting the claim. Claimants will provide documentation, which is reasonably available, to corroborate the nature, extent and value of their losses and/or to execute affidavits in a form established by OCGFC. FEMA may compensate a Claimant for a Loss in the absence of supporting documentation, in its discretion, on the strength of an affidavit or Proof of Loss executed by the Claimant, if documentary evidence substantiating the loss is not reasonably available. FEMA may request that a business Claimant execute an affidavit, which states that the Claimant will provide documentary evidence, including but not limited to income tax returns, if requested by our DHS Office of the Inspector General or the Government Accountability Office during an audit of the claim. 
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Proof of Loss.</I> All Claimants are required to attest to the nature and extent of each Loss for which compensation is sought in the Proof of Loss. The Proof of Loss, which will be in a form specified by OCGFC, must be signed by the Claimant or the Claimant's legal representative if the Claimant is a not an individual or is an individual who lacks the legal capacity to execute the Proof of Loss. The Proof of Loss must be signed under penalty of perjury and subject to the provisions of 18 U.S.C.1001, which establishes penalties for false statements. Non-subrogation Claimants who filed a Notice of Loss before January 1, 2001 should submit a signed Proof of Loss to OCGFC not later than June 19, 2001. Non-subrogation Claimants who file a Notice of Loss on or after January 1, 2001 should submit a signed Proof of Loss to OCGFC not later than 150 days after the date when the Notice of Loss was submitted. These deadlines may be extended at the discretion of the Director of OCGFC for good cause. If a non-subrogation Claimant fails to submit a signed Proof of Loss within the timeframes set forth in this section and does not obtain an extension from the Director of OCGFC, OCGFC may administratively close the claim and require the Claimant to repay any partial payments made on the claim. Subrogation Claimants will submit the Proof of Loss contemporaneously with filing the Notice of Loss. 
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Release and Certification Form.</I> All Claimants who receive compensation under the CGFAA are required to sign a Release and Certification Form. The Release and Certification Form must be executed by the Claimant or the Claimant's legal representative if the Claimant is an entity or lacks the legal capacity to execute the Release and Certification Form. The Release and Certification Form must be received by OCGFC within 120 days of the date when the Authorized Official's Determination is rendered under § 295.32, or if subsequent proceedings occur under Subpart E of these regulations, not later than 60 days after the date when further review of the decision (if available) is precluded. The United States will not attempt to recover compensatory damages paid to a Claimant who has executed and returned a Release and Certification Form within the periods provided above, except in the case of fraud or misrepresentation by the Claimant or the Claimant's representative, failure of the Claimant to cooperate with an audit as required by § 295.35 or a material mistake by FEMA.

FEMA will not reimburse Claimant for the cost of appraisals, or other third party opinions, not requested by OCGFC. 
</P>
<P>(b) FEMA will provide a lump sum payment for incidental expenses incurred in claims preparation to individual and business Claimants that are awarded compensatory damages under the CGFAA after a properly executed Release and Certification Form has been returned to OCGFC. The amount of the lump sum payment will be the greater of $100 or 5% of CGFAA compensatory damages and insurance proceeds recovered by the Claimant for Cerro Grande Fire related losses (not including the lump sum payment or monies reimbursed under the CGFAA for the purchase of flood insurance), but will not exceed $15,000. No more than one lump sum payment will be made to all Claimants in a Household, regardless of whether the Household filed separate or combined Notices of Loss.

</P>
<P>(c) <I>Settlement and mediation alternatives.</I> At any time after a request for arbitration is filed and before the time a decision is rendered, either party may request in writing that the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office stay further proceedings in the arbitration to facilitate settlement discussions. A mediator may be appointed (if requested by the parties) to facilitate settlement discussions. If both parties concur in the request, the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will stay the arbitration and appoint a mediator at our expense. The stay may be terminated and the arbitration resumed upon written request of either party to the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office. If the dispute is settled, the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will issue an order terminating the arbitration and provide the Claimant with a Release and Certification Form. 
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Selection of arbitrator.</I> Arbitrators will be selected from a list of qualified arbitrators who have agreed to serve provided by the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office. If the amount in dispute is $300,000 or less, the arbitration will be decided by one arbitrator selected by the Claimant from the list. If the amount in dispute exceeds $300,000, a panel of three arbitrators selected at random by the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will decide the arbitration.

</P>
<P>(g) <I>Decision.</I> After reviewing the evidence, the arbitrator(s) will render a decision in writing to the Alternate Dispute Resolution Office. The Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will transmit the decision to the Claimant and the Director of OCGFC. If a panel of three arbitrators conducts the arbitration, at least two of the three arbitrators must sign the decision. The decision will be rendered no later than 10 Days after a hearing is concluded or 60 Days after the arbitration is initiated, whichever is earlier. The Alternate Dispute Resolution Office may extend the time for a decision. The decision will establish the compensation due to the Claimant, if any, and the reasons therefore. 
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Action on arbitration decision.</I> The Alternate Dispute Resolution Office will forward the arbitration decision and a Release and Certification Form to the Claimant. A Claimant who has received or who has been awarded any compensation under the CGFAA must sign and return the Release and Certification Form, regardless of whether any additional compensation is awarded by the arbitration.

<DIV8 N="§ 296.5" NODE="44:1.0.1.5.61.1.10.5" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 296.5   Overview of the claims process.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Act is intended to provide persons who suffered Injury from the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire with a simple, expedited process to seek compensation from the United States. This section provides a brief explanation of the claims process for claims other than subrogation claims. It is not intended to supersede the more specific regulations that follow and explain the claims process in greater detail. To obtain compensation under the Act, an Injured Person must submit all Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire related claims against the United States or any employee, officer, or agency of the United States to the FEMA Claims Office. An Injured Person who elects to accept an award under the Act is barred from accepting an award pursuant to a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act or a civil action against the United States or any employee, officer, or agency of the United States arising out of or relating to the same subject matter. Judicial review of FEMA decisions under the Act is available.
</P>
<P>(b) The first step in the process is to file a Notice of Loss with the Claims Office. The Claims Office will provide the claimant with a written acknowledgement that the claim has been filed and a claim number.
</P>
<P>(c) Shortly thereafter, a Claims Reviewer will contact the claimant to review the claim. Claims Reviewer will help the claimant formulate a strategy for obtaining any necessary documentation or other support. This assistance does not relieve the claimant of their responsibility for establishing all elements of the injuries and the compensatory damages that are sought, including that the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire caused the injuries. After the claimant has had an opportunity to discuss the claim with the Claims Reviewer, a Proof of Loss will be presented to the claimant for signature. After any necessary documentation has been obtained and the claim has been fully evaluated, the Claims Reviewer will submit a report to the Authorized Official. The Claims Reviewer is responsible for providing an objective evaluation of the claim to the Authorized Official.
</P>
<P>(d) The Authorized Official will review the report and determine whether compensation is due to the claimant. The claimant will be notified in writing of the Authorized Official's determination. If the claimant is satisfied with the decision, payment will be made after the claimant returns a completed Release and Certification Form. If the claimant is dissatisfied with the Authorized Official's determination, an administrative appeal may be filed with the Director of the Claims Office. If the claimant remains dissatisfied after the appeal is decided, the dispute may be resolved through binding arbitration or heard in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico.

A subrogee may file a Notice of Loss without regard to whether the Injured Person who received payment from the subrogee filed a Notice of Loss. A Subrogation Notice of Loss should be filed after the subrogee has made all payments that it believes the Injured Person is entitled to receive for Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire related injuries under the terms of the insurance policy or other agreement between the subrogee and the Injured Person, but not later than November 14, 2024. By filing a Notice of Loss for any subrogated claim, the subrogee elects the Act as its exclusive remedy against the United States or any employee, officer, or agency of the United States for all subrogated claims arising out of the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire. Subrogation claims must be made on a Notice of Loss form furnished by the Claims Office and such claims will be paid only after paying claims submitted by injured persons that are not insurance companies seeking payment as subrogees.

<HEAD>§ 296.21   Allowable damages.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Allowable damages.</I> The Act provides for the payment of actual compensatory damages for injury or loss of property, business loss, and financial loss. The laws of the State of New Mexico will apply to the calculation of damages. Damages must be reasonable in amount.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Exclusions.</I> Punitive damages, statutory damages under section 30-32-4 of the New Mexico Statutes Annotated (2019), interest on claims, attorney's fees and agents' fees incurred in prosecuting a claim under the Act or an insurance policy, and adjusting costs incurred by an insurer or other third party with the rights of a subrogee that may be owed by a claimant as a consequence of receiving an award are not recoverable from FEMA. The cost to a claimant of prosecuting a claim under the Act does not constitute compensatory damages and is not recoverable from FEMA, except as provided in § 296.31(b).
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Loss of property.</I> Compensatory damages may be awarded for an uninsured or underinsured property loss, a decrease in the value of real property, damage to physical infrastructure, cost resulting from lost subsistence, cost of reforestation or revegetation not covered by any other Federal program, and any other loss that the Administrator determines to be appropriate for inclusion as a loss of property.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Real property and contents.</I> Compensatory damages for the damage or destruction of real property and its contents may include the reasonable cost of reconstruction of a structure comparable in design, construction materials, size, and improvements, taking into account post-fire construction costs in the community in which the structure existed before the fire and current building codes and standards. Compensatory damages may also include the cost of removing debris and burned trees, including hazardous materials or soils, stabilizing the land, replacing contents, and compensation for any decrease in the value of land on which the structure sat pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Reforestation and revegetation.</I> Compensatory damages may be awarded for the cost of replacement of destroyed trees and landscaping.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Decrease in the value of real property.</I> Compensatory damages may be awarded for a decrease in the value of real property that a claimant owned before the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire if:
</P>
<P>(i) The claimant sells the real property in a good faith, arm's length transaction that is closed no later than November 14, 2024 and realizes a loss in the pre-fire value; or
</P>
<P>(ii) The claimant can establish that the value of the real property was significantly diminished long-term as a result of the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Subsistence.</I> Compensatory damages will be awarded for lost Subsistence Resources.
</P>
<P>(i) FEMA may reimburse an injured party for the reasonable cost of replacing Subsistence Resources customarily and traditionally used by the claimant on or before April 6, 2022, but no longer available to the claimant as a result of the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire. For each category of Subsistence Resources, the claimant must elect to receive compensatory damages either for the increased cost of obtaining Subsistence Resources from lands not damaged by the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire or for the cost of procuring substitute resources in the cash economy.
</P>
<P>(ii) FEMA may consider evidence submitted by claimants, Indian Tribes, and other knowledgeable sources in determining the nature and extent of a claimant's subsistence uses.
</P>
<P>(iii) Compensatory damages for subsistence losses will be paid for the period between April 6, 2022 and the date when Subsistence Resources can reasonably be expected to return to the level of availability that existed before the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire. FEMA may rely upon the advice of experts in making this determination.
</P>
<P>(iv) Long-term damage awards for subsistence resources will be made to claimants in the form of lump sum cash payments.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Physical infrastructure.</I> Compensatory damages may be awarded for the damage to physical infrastructure, including damages to irrigation infrastructure such as acequia systems.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Business loss.</I> Compensatory damages may be awarded for damage to tangible assets or inventory, including timber, crops, and other natural resources; business interruption losses; overhead costs; employee wages for work not performed; loss of business net income; and any other loss that the Administrator determines to be appropriate for inclusion as a business loss.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Financial loss.</I> Compensatory damages may be awarded for increased mortgage interest costs, insurance deductibles, temporary living or relocation expenses, lost wages or personal income, emergency staffing expenses, debris removal and other cleanup costs, costs of reasonable heightened risk reduction, premiums for flood insurance, and any other loss that the Administrator determines to be appropriate for inclusion as financial loss.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Recovery loans.</I> FEMA will reimburse claimants awarded compensation under the Act for interest paid on loans, including Small Business Administration disaster loans obtained after April 6, 2022 for damages resulting from the Fire. Interest will be reimbursed for the period beginning on the date that the loan was taken out and ending on the date when the claimant receives a compensation award (other than a partial payment). Claimants are required to use the proceeds of their compensation award to repay Small Business Administration disaster loans. FEMA will cooperate with the Small Business Administration to formulate procedures for assuring that claimants repay Small Business Administration disaster loans contemporaneously with the receipt of their compensation award.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Flood insurance.</I> FEMA will reimburse claimants for flood insurance premiums to be paid on or before May 31, 2024 if, as a result of the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire, a claimant who was not required to purchase flood insurance before the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire is required to purchase flood insurance or the claimant did not maintain flood insurance before the Fire but purchased flood insurance after the Fire due to fear of heightened flood risk. Alternatively, FEMA may provide flood insurance to such claimants directly through a group or blanket policy.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Out of pocket expenses for treatment of mental health conditions.</I> FEMA may reimburse an individual claimant for reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred for treatment of a mental health condition rendered by a licensed mental health professional, which condition resulted from or was worsened by the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire. FEMA will not reimburse for treatment identified after November 14, 2024.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Donations.</I> FEMA will compensate claimants for the cost of merchandise, use of equipment or other non-personal services, directly or indirectly donated to survivors of the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire not later than November 14, 2022. Donations will be valued at cost.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Heightened risk reduction.</I> FEMA will reimburse claimants for the costs incurred to implement reasonable measures necessary to reduce risks from natural hazards heightened by the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire to the level of risk prevailing before the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire. Such measures may include, for example, risk reduction projects that reduce an increased risk from flooding, mudslides, and landslides in and around burn scars. Claimants seeking compensation for heightened risk reduction must include the claim in their Notice of Loss by November 14, 2024 or an amended Notice of Loss filed no later than November 14, 2025. Claimants should take into account current building codes and standards and must complete the risk reduction project for which they receive compensation.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Insurance and other benefits.</I> The Act allows FEMA to compensate Injured Persons only for damages not paid, and that will not be paid, by insurance or other third-party payments or settlements.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Insurance.</I> Claimants who carry insurance will be required to disclose the name of the insurer(s) and the nature of the insurance and provide the Claims Office with such insurance documentation as the Claims Office reasonably requests.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Coordination with FEMA's Public Assistance Program.</I> Injured Persons eligible for disaster assistance under FEMA's Public Assistance Program are expected to apply for all available assistance. Pursuant to the Act, the Federal share of the costs for Public Assistance projects is 100 percent. Compensation will not be awarded under the Act for injuries or costs that are eligible under the Public Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Benefits provided by FEMA's Individual Assistance program.</I> Compensation under the Act will not be awarded for injuries or costs that have been reimbursed under the Federal Assistance to Individual and Households Program or any other FEMA Individual Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Worker's compensation claims.</I> Individuals who have suffered injuries that are compensable under State or Federal worker's compensation laws must apply for all benefits available under such laws.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Benefits provided by non-governmental organizations and individuals.</I> Gifts or donations made to a claimant by a non-governmental organization or an individual, other than wages paid by the claimant's employer or insurance payments, will be disregarded in evaluating claims and need not be disclosed to the Claims Office by claimants.

<HEAD>§ 296.30   Establishing injuries and damages.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Burden of proof.</I> The burden of proving injuries and damages rests with the claimant. A claimant may submit for the Administrative Record a statement explaining why the claimant believes that the injuries and damages are compensable and any documentary evidence supporting the claim. Claimants will provide documentation, which is reasonably available, including photographs and video, to corroborate the nature, extent, and value of their injuries and/or to execute affidavits in a form established by the Claims Office. FEMA may compensate a claimant for an injury in the absence of supporting documentation, in its discretion, on the strength of an affidavit or Proof of Loss executed by the claimant, if documentary evidence substantiating the injury is not reasonably available. FEMA may also require an inspection of real property. FEMA may request that a business claimant execute an affidavit, which states that the claimant will provide documentary evidence, including but not limited to income tax returns, if requested by the DHS Office of the Inspector General or the Government Accountability Office during an audit of the claim.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Proof of Loss.</I> All claimants are required to attest to the nature and extent of each injury for which compensation is sought in the Proof of Loss. The Proof of Loss, which will be in a form specified by the Claims Office, must be signed by the claimant or the claimant's legal representative if the claimant is not an individual or is an individual who lacks the legal capacity to execute the Proof of Loss. The Proof of Loss must be signed under penalty of perjury. Non-subrogation claimants should submit a signed Proof of Loss to the Claims Office not later than 150 days after the date when the Notice of Loss was submitted. This deadline may be extended at the discretion of the Director of the Claims Office for good cause. If a non-subrogation claimant fails to submit a signed Proof of Loss within the timeframes set forth in this section and does not obtain an extension from the Director of the Claims Office, the Claims Office may administratively close the claim and require the claimant to repay any partial payments made on the claim. Subrogation claimants will submit the Proof of Loss contemporaneously with filing the Notice of Loss.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Release and Certification Form.</I> All claimants who receive compensation under the Act are required to sign a Release and Certification Form, including for partial payments under § 296.33. The Release and Certification Form must be executed by the claimant or the claimant's legal representative if the claimant is an entity or lacks the legal capacity to execute the Release and Certification Form. A Release and Certification Form must be received by the Claims Office before the Claims Office provides payment on the claim. The United States will not attempt to recover compensatory damages paid to a claimant who has executed and returned a Release and Certification Form within the periods provided above, except in the case of fraud or misrepresentation by the claimant or the claimant's representative, failure of the claimant to cooperate with an audit as required by § 296.36 or a material mistake by FEMA.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Authority to settle or compromise claims.</I> Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Director of the Claims Office may extend an offer to settle or compromise a claim or any portion of a claim at any time during the process outlined in this part, which if accepted by the claimant will be binding on the claimant and on the United States, except that the United States may recover funds improperly paid to a claimant due to fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the claimant or the claimant's representative, a material mistake on FEMA's part or the claimant's failure to cooperate in an audit as required by § 296.36.

<HEAD>§ 296.31   Reimbursement of claim expenses.</HEAD>
<P>(a) FEMA will reimburse claimants for the reasonable costs they incur in providing documentation requested by the Claims Office. FEMA will also reimburse claimants for the reasonable costs they incur in providing appraisals, or other third-party opinions that the Claims Office deems necessary to determine the amount of the claim. FEMA will not reimburse claimants for the cost of appraisals or other third-party opinions not deemed necessary by the Claims Office.
</P>
<P>(b) FEMA will provide a lump sum payment for incidental expenses incurred in claims preparation to claimants that are awarded compensatory damages under the Act after a properly executed Release and Certification Form has been returned to the Claims Office. The amount of the lump sum payment will be the greater of $150 or 5% of the Act's compensatory damages and insurance proceeds recovered by the claimant for Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire related injuries (not including the lump sum payment or monies reimbursed under the Act for the purchase of flood insurance) but will not exceed $25,000. Subrogation claimants and claimants whose only Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire related loss is for flood insurance premiums will not be eligible.

<HEAD>§ 296.32   Determination of compensation due to claimant.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Authorized Official's report.</I> After the Claims Office has evaluated all elements of a claim as stated in the Proof of Loss, the Authorized Official will issue, and provide the claimant with a copy of, the Authorized Official's determination.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Claimant's options upon issuance of the Authorized Official's determination.</I> Not later than 120 days after the date that appears on the Authorized Official's determination, the claimant must either accept the determination by submitting a Release and Certification Form to FEMA and/or initiate an Administrative Appeal in accordance with § 296.41. Claimants must sign the Release and Certification Form to receive payment on their claims (including for partial payments). The claimant will receive payment of compensation awarded by the Authorized Official after FEMA receives the completed Release and Certification Form. If the claimant does not either submit a Release and Certification Form to FEMA or initiate an Administrative Appeal no later than 120 days after the date that appears on the Authorized Official's determination, the claimant will be conclusively presumed to have accepted the Authorized Official's determination. The Director of the Claims Office may modify the deadlines set forth in this subsection at the request of a claimant for good cause shown.

<HEAD>§ 296.33   Partial payments.</HEAD>
<P>The Claims Office at the request of a claimant may make one or more partial payments on any aspect of a claim that is severable. Receipt by a claimant of a partial payment is contingent on the claimant signing a Release and Certification Form for the severable part of the claim for which partial payment is being made. Acceptance of a partial payment in no way affects a claimant's ability to pursue an Administrative Appeal of the Authorized Official's determination or to pursue other rights afforded by the Act with respect to any portion of a claim for which a Release and Certification Form has not been executed. The Claims Office decision on whether to provide a partial payment cannot be appealed.

<P>A claimant may amend the Notice of Loss to include additional claims at any time before signing a Proof of Loss. After the claimant has submitted a Proof of Loss and before submission of a Release and Certification Form, a claimant may request that the Director of the Claims Office consider one or more injuries not addressed in the Proof of Loss. The request must be submitted in writing to the Director of the Claims Office and received not later than the deadline for filing an Administrative Appeal under § 296.32 or November 14, 2024, whichever is earlier. It must be supported by the claimant's explanation of why the injury was not previously reported. If good cause is found to consider the additional injury, the Director will determine whether compensation is due to the claimant for the Loss under the Administrative Appeal procedures described in § 296.41.

Claimants may request to reopen claims where the claimant has incurred additional losses under § 296.21(c)(1) as part of a reconstruction in excess of those previously awarded or the Director of the Claims Office otherwise determines that claimant has demonstrated good cause no later than the deadline established by the Director of the Claims Office as published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> and at <I>https://www.fema.gov/hermits-peak.</I>

The arbitration will be decided by one arbitrator if the amount in dispute is $500,000 or less and a panel of three arbitrators if the amount in dispute exceeds $500,000. Arbitrators will be assigned by the Arbitration Administrator through a random drawing.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Conduct of arbitration.</I> Pursuant to guidelines from the Arbitration Administrator, which will be provided directly to claimants who have filed a request for arbitration, the arbitration process will include an arbitration hearing with consideration of the claimant's written request for arbitration, the Administrative Record, and oral testimony.

<P>(d) <I>Approval of State administrative plan and annual submission.</I> If the State administrative plan and the annual submission are determined to be approvable, the Regional Administrator will so notify the State in writing. The State administrative plan is a one-time submission. Unless amendments are necessary to meet Federal standards prescribed in the regulations in this part or in CPG 1-3 or to reflect changes in the State's administrative structure, procedures, criteria, or activities, or unless a portion were conditionally approved by the Regional Administrator as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section, no approval regarding the State administrative plan will be required for a State which participated for the preceding Federal fiscal year.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Agreement for contribution.</I> Approval pursuant to procedures and criteria described in this part and in CPG 1-3 of an annual submission of a State whose administrative plan is approved and current shall constitute agreement between FEMA and the State as grantee for its participation and that of its subgrantees in this program during the Federal fiscal year covered by the approved annual submission on the basis of the requirements and conditions prescribed in this part, in CPG 1-3, and in other federally promulgated criteria referenced in this part. Refusal or failure to comply with such requirements and conditions may result in the grantor agency cancelling, terminating, or suspending the grant, in whole or in part, and refraining from extending any further assistance to the grantee or subgrantee until satisfactory assurance of future compliance has been received.

<DIV8 N="§ 302.5" NODE="44:1.0.1.6.65.0.10.5" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 302.5   Allocations and reallocations.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Administrator shall allocate the entire amount of funds available for the purposes of this program from the appropriation for each fiscal year. The allocation made to each State represents the total amount of funds available to pay the Federal share of necessary and essential civil defense personnel and administrative expenses of the State and its participating subdivisions during the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>(b) The first calculation for developing the allocation for each State will be a formula distribution in accordance with section 205(d) of the Act, made by applying the following percentages to the total sum of Emergency Management Assistance in the President's budget request to Congress:
</P>
<P>(1) Fifty (50) percent will be allocated on the basis of the prior-year State allocations, in fulfilment of the statutory requirement to give due regard to “the relative state of development of civil defense readiness of the State” (State and local levels).
</P>
<P>(2) Thirty-three (33) percent will be allocated on the basis of the ratio of the State's population to the national population (50 States, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico), in fulfilment of the statutory requirements to give due regard to “population” and to “the criticality of target and support areas and the areas which may be affected by natural disasters with respect to the development of the total civil defense readiness of the Nation.”
</P>
<P>(3) Fifteen (15) percent will be divided equally among the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>(4) In consonance with the statutory provision allowing the Administrator to prescribe other factors concerning the State allocations, the remaining two (2) percent will be held temporarily in reserve, to be used first to fund the four territories of the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Conditions peculiar to those areas make strict application of the mathematical formula in § 302.5(b) inequitable. Therefore, the Administrator will consider prior-year allocations, percentage of total United States population, and the factors set out in § 302.5(e) (1), (2), (4), and (5) in determining their allocations. The remaining balance of the reserve fund will then be used to restore any State which would receive less by formula share than its formula share for the previous fiscal year, provided that the reserve balance is sufficient to do this for all such States. Any remaining balance after this has been done will constitute a supplemental fund from which the Administrator will consider State requests for additional funding and the needs of any interstate civil defense authorities.
</P>
<P>(c) For initial planning purposes only, each State will then be informed of the figure by the Regional Administrator. The State will base its initial EMA application upon that figure but may request a smaller amount or with appropriate justification a larger amount.
</P>
<P>(d) The amount requested by the State shall not exceed 50 percent of its estimate of necessary and essential State and local personnel and administrative expenses for the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>(e) The formula distribution shall be reviewed and evaluated, and adjusted as appropriate, by the Administrator, based on the current situation in each State, the requests of all States, and recommendations by the Regional Administrators. The Administrator will consider the following five factors:
</P>
<P>(1) The ability of the State and its subgrantees to effectively expend such an amount for necessary and essential civil defense personnel and administrative purposes. Past performance is a factor in this determination.
</P>
<P>(2) Special circumstances existing in the State at the time of allocating which require unusual expenditures for civil defense.
</P>
<P>(3) Conditions peculiar to the State which make strict application of mathematical formula inequitable either to that State or other States.
</P>
<P>(4) The relative cost of civil defense personnel and administrative services in that State; that is, whether such costs are considerably above or below the national average for similar services and expenses.
</P>
<P>(5) Substantial changes in the civil defense readiness of the State not reflected by its recent civil defense expenditures.
</P>
<P>(f) In September of each year, based on applications received and recommendations by the Regional Administrators, the Administrator will make a tentative allocation to the States. This will include adjustments for States that have indicated they will not be using the total of the formula distribution amount. States can then revise their earlier plans and applications to more nearly reflect the level of funding expected to become available.
</P>
<P>(g) A State may provide to the Regional Administrator a preliminary annual submission in an amount not to exceed its tentative allocation.
</P>
<P>(h) By September 30 (or as soon thereafter as feasible), the Administrator will make a formal allocation based on, or subject to, appropriation by Congress and allotment of the funds. This allocation for each State may include any additional amounts from the reserve portion of the EMA funds, and shall be in accordance with the regulations in this part and CPG 1-3.
</P>
<P>(i) Upon the appropriation becoming available, and if requested by a State, the Regional Administrator may approve such State's preliminary annual submission (if found to meet all requirements in this part and CPG 1-3) in an appropriate amount which does not exceed the amount of the State's share of the Administrator's formal allocation of the Federal appropriation. An award document obligating Federal funds on the basis of the approved preliminary annual submission may be executed in accordance with the provisions of CPG 1-3.
</P>
<P>(j) Based on and within 60 days after notification of its formal allocation, each State must provide to the Regional Administrator a final annual submission which meets all requirements in this part and CPG 1-3. If no changes are necessary, a State and the Regional Administrator may adopt in writing the State's preliminary annual submission as its final annual submission. If no award document was executed based on a State's preliminary annual submission, such document will be executed on the basis of that State's approved final annual submission.
</P>
<P>(k) With regard to any State whose award document was executed pursuant to a preliminary annual submission covering only part of its formal allocation, upon approval (by the Regional Administrator) of the final annual submission (including a revised statement of work supporting the additional funding request) the Regional Administrator shall execute an amended award document obligating the balance of such State's formal allocation.
</P>
<P>(l) After being advised of its annual formal allocation, if a State fails to submit, within 60 days, an approvable annual submission in the amount of its allocation, the Regional Administrator may reallocate the unused portion to other States in the region in such amounts as in his/her judgment will best assure adequate development of the civil defense capability of the Nation. The exception to this authority is in the event a State, or local jurisdiction, refuses to participate in attack preparedness activities. EMA funds withheld or returned for that reason are to be released to headquarters for reallocation on a national basis. In addition, the Regional Administrator may from time to time reallocate the amounts released by a State from its allocation as no longer being required for utilization in accordance with an approved annual submission and award document.
</P>
<P>(m) Immediate notice to the headquarters EMA Program Manager of State reallocations is required in the form of copies of EMA-approved Annual Submission amendment documents, accompanied by copies of assistance award/amendment documents signed by regional and State authorized officials of both the releasing and recipient States.
</P>
<P>(n) There is no dollar ceiling on the amount of funds that may be reallocated among States in a region. However, at any time that there are funds surplus to the eligible needs of the States within a region, those funds should be promptly released to headquarters for reallocation to other States with unfunded additional requirements.
</P>
<P>(o) On July 1 of each fiscal year, the authority to reallocate EMA funds shall revert to the Administrator. In addition, any excess EMA funds available on that date, or that become available during the remainder of the fiscal year, are to be promptly released to headquarters for reallocation by the Administrator.

<P>(4) Upon expiration of current procurement contracts in a facility, the procuring agency shall take such of the following actions as are compatible with its plans for maintaining a state of readiness:
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Government-owned facilities and tools.</I> Within the limitations that may be imposed by Congressional appropriations, place government-owned facilities and tools in standby status and establish provisions for their adequate maintenance.

<P>(ii) <I>Privately-owned facilities and government-owned tools.</I> (A) Arrange with management of privately-owned facilities, wherever possible, to place government-owned tools and production equipment in the status provided by DMO-VII-4, as amended, taking into account the desirability of safe location.
</P>
<P>(B) Arrange with management, on a voluntary basis, to keep a group of key managers, engineers, and skilled workers familiar with the items planned for mobilization production.
</P>
<P>(C) Determine the gaps which exist in government-owned packages of tools and production equipment needed to produce mobilization requirements in privately-owned plants. Within the limit of fund availability, plan the procurement of such tools and equipment with priority being given to long lead-time tools and equipment or those not used in general manufacturing. These tools and equipment, when procured, should be placed in the status provided by DMO-VII-4, as amended, taking into account the desirability of safe locations.

<HEAD>§ 323.3   Responsibilities.</HEAD>
<P>(a) As stated in The National Plan for Emergency Preparedness, the direction of resources mobilization is a Federal responsibility. However, in the period immediately following an attack, certain geographical areas may be temporarily isolated, and State and local governments will assume responsibility for the use of resources remaining in such areas until effective Federal authority can be restored. State and local governments will not assume responsibility for resources under the jurisdiction of a Federal agency where the Federal agency is able to function.
</P>
<P>(b) As soon as possible after an attack and until specific national direction and guidance on the use of resources is provided, Federal, State, and local officials will determine what resources are available, to what needs they can be applied, how they are to be used, and the extent to which resources are deficient or in excess of survival needs. They will base determinations as to the relative urgency for use of resources primarily upon the importance of specific needs of defense, survival, and recovery.

<P>The following activities are to be accorded priority over all other claims for resources. There is no significance in the order of the listing—all are important. The order in which and the extent to which they are supported locally may vary with local conditions and circumstances. If local conditions necessitate the establishment of an order of priority among these activities, that order shall be based on determinations of relative urgency among the activities listed, the availability of resources for achieving the actions required, and the feasibility and timeliness of the activities in making the most rapid and effective contribution to national survival.
</P>
<P>(a) The immediate defense and retaliatory combat operations of the Armed Forces of the United States and its Allies: This includes support of military personnel and the production and distribution of military and atomic weapons, materials and equipment required to carry out these immediate defense and retaliatory combat operations.
</P>
<P>(b) Maintenance or reestablishment of Government authority and control to restore and preserve order and to assure direction of emergency operations essential for the safety and protection of the people. This includes:
</P>
<P>(1) Police protection and movement direction;
</P>
<P>(2) Fire defense, rescue and debris clearance;
</P>
<P>(3) Warnings;

</P>
<P>(a) Protect and to prevent waste or dissipation of resources prior to their assignment to priority activities;
</P>
<P>(b) Support production of essential goods. Other production will be permitted to continue only from inventories on hand and when there is no emergency requirement for the resources vital to this production.
</P>

<HEAD>Appendix 1 to Part 323—List of Essential Survival Items
</HEAD>
<P>This document contains a list of items considered essential to sustain life at a productive level to assure national survival in an emergency. The list identifies items to which major attention should be given in all phases of preattack planning to insure the availability of basic essentials for a productive economy in the event of a nuclear attack. Supply-requirements studies and assessments for these items will be made to disclose critical deficiencies or other problems that can be anticipated. Revisions will be made as necessary to keep the items as up-to-date as possible.
</P>
<P>The items are arranged by seven major groups:
</P>
<P>(1) Health Supplies and Equipment,
</P>
<P>(2) Food,
</P>
<P>(3) Body Protection and Household Operations,
</P>
<P>(4) Electric Power and Fuels,
</P>
<P>(5) Sanitation and Water Supply,
</P>
<P>(6) Emergency Housing and Construction Materials and Equipment, and
</P>
<P>(7) General Use Items.
</P>
<P>Survival items are defined as “those items without which large segments of the population would die or have their health so seriously impaired as to render them both burdensome and non-productive.” The items have been classified into Group A or Group B, with Group A representing end products consumed or used directly by the population, and Group B consisting of those items essential to the effective production and utilization of the Group A items, which are consumed or used directly by the people.
</P>
<P>There are no Group B items in the categories of Health Supplies and Equipment, Body Production and Household Operations, and Emergency Housing and Construction Materials and Equipment. All of these items are considered to be consumed directly and any attempt to separate them in to A and B groupings would be too arbitrary to be meaningful.
</P>
<P>It is important to keep in mind the fact that while the items listed are the basic essentials necessary for maintaining a viable economy during the first six months following an attack, not all of them would create problems that would require government action preattack to insure adequate supplies. The aforementioned supply-requirements studies will be undertaken to identify the problem areas. In developing supply data, all available production capacity, existing inventories, and possible substitutions will be considered. For example, in analyzing clothing items, all available supplies would be considered from sport to dress shirts, from overalls to dress suits. However, new production would be limited to the simplest form of the basic item which can be produced. The final determination as to which of the items are most critical and which may require preattack actions by the Government, as well as the type of actions which must be taken, can be made only after a comprehensive supply-requirements analysis is completed.

<P>(a) This part applies to all Federal departments and agencies having, for purposes of mobilization readiness, Government-owned industrial plant equipment under their jurisdiction or control and having emergency preparedness functions assigned by Executive orders concerning use of that equipment.
</P>
<P>(b) As used herein, <I>industrial plant equipment</I> means those items of equipment, each with an acquisition cost of $1,000 or more, that fall within specified classes of equipment listed in DOD regulations. Classes of equipment may from time to time be added to or deleted from this list.

<HEAD>§ 327.3   Policy.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> (1) Primary reliance for defense production shall be placed upon private industry.
</P>
<P>(2) When it is determined by an agency that, because of the lack of specific industrial plant equipment, private industry of the United States cannot be relied upon for needed Government production, that agency may provide to private industry such Government-owned industrial plant equipment as is deemed necessary to ensure required production capability. Requirements for such equipment should be reviewed at least annually to ascertain the continuing need, particularly with a view toward private industry furnishing the equipment for long term requirements.
</P>
<P>(3) When it is necessary for Federal agencies to supply Government-owned industrial plant equipment to private industry, these agencies will maintain uniformity and fairness in the arrangements for the use of this equipment by following regulations for the use of such equipment as developed and published by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to section 809 of Public Law 93-155. The regulations to be developed by the Secretary of Defense shall be in consonance with this order. These regulations will attempt to ensure that no Government contractor is afforded an advantage over his competitors and that Government-owned industrial plant equipment is maintained properly and kept immediately available for the emergency preparedness needs of the United States.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Interagency use of idle equipment.</I> In any instances in which a Government contractor cannot meet Government production schedules because necessary industrial plant equipment is not available from private industry or from the contracting Federal department or agency, idle industrial plant equipment under the control of other Federal agencies may be made available for this purpose through existing authorities on a transfer, loan, or replacement basis by interagency agreement.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Availability of equipment for emergency use.</I> Government-owned industrial plant equipment may be provided by controlling agencies for emergency use by essential Government contractors whose facilities have been damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Uniform rental rates.</I> All new agreements entered into by any agency of the Federal Government under which private business establishments are provided with Government-owned industrial plant equipment shall be subject to rental rates established by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to section 809 of Public Law 93-155. The rental rates shall ensure a fair and equitable return to the U.S. Government and be generally competitive with commercial rates for like equipment.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Use of Government-owned industrial plant equipment for commercial</I> (<I>non-Government</I>) <I>purposes.</I> Subject to adequate controls being established under DOD regulations pursuant to Public Law 93-155, and statutory authority for leasing, Government-owned industrial plant equipment may be authorized for commercial use by contractors performing contracts or subcontracts for the Government agency if it is necessary to keep the equipment in a high state of operational readiness through regular usage to support the emergency preparedness programs of the U.S. Government.

</P>
<P>(a) Priority ratings under title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, are not authorized for certain FSC Groups, Classes, and Items:
</P>
<P>(1) Which are of the types commonly available in commercial markets for general consumption,
</P>
<P>(2) Which do not require major modification when purchased for military or other ratable government use, and
</P>
<P>(3) Which are in sufficient supply as to cause no hindrance to the accomplishment of military or other national defense objectives.
</P>
<FP>Such Groups, Classes, and Items will be as specified from time to time by the Department of Commerce with the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Procurement in these Groups, Classes, and Items is to be made without priority assistance, including single service procurement that may include defense and defense-supporting needs. In the event procurement difficulties are encountered which threaten timely delivery, application for special assistance may be made for those categories of supply authorized special assistance in existing lists, and must be accompanied by full justification to support the need for such assistance.
</FP>
<P>(b) Priority ratings may be used for the procurement of other authorized FSC Groups, Classes, and Items only in quantities required to meet the needs of approved programs of ratable agencies. The quantities of current procurement of each Group, Class, and Item shall be based on and shall not exceed the ratio of rated purchases to total purchases for that Group, Class, and Item that was consummated in the 6-month period preceding the first day of January and July in each year. Any other periodic cycle considered suitable and agreed to by the Domestic and International Business Administration, Department of Commerce, and the procuring agency may be substituted.
</P>
<P>(c) In the interest of minimizing administrative costs, where rated procurement under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, constitutes 97 percent or more of the total procurement of a Group, Class, or Item, all of the Group, Class, or Item may be bought on ratings.

<HEAD>§ 331.1   Purpose.</HEAD>
<P>Success of the national defense program depends upon efficient use of all of our resources, including the labor force and production facilities, which are preserved through utilizing the skills of both management and labor. A primary aim of Federal manpower policy is to encourage full utilization of existing production facilities and workers in preference to creating new plants or moving workers, thus assisting in the maintenance of economic balance and employment stability. When large numbers of new workers move to labor surplus areas, heavy burdens are placed on community facilities, such as schools, hospitals, housing, transportation, and utilities. On the other hand, when unemployment develops in certain areas, unemployment costs increase the total cost to the Government, and plants, tools, and workers' skills remain idle and unable to contribute to our national defense program. Consequently, it is the purpose of Defense Manpower Policy No. 4B to direct attention to the potential of labor surplus areas when awarding appropriate procurement contracts and when locating new plants or facilities.

<HEAD>§ 333.2   Program eligibility.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Certain programs to promote the national defense are eligible for priorities and allocations support. These include programs for military and energy production or construction, military or critical infrastructure assistance to any foreign nation, deployment and sustainment of military forces, homeland security, stockpiling, space, and any directly related activity. Other eligible programs include emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to Title VI of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5195 <I>et seq.</I>) and critical infrastructure protection and restoration.

When a “requirements contract,” “basic ordering agreement,” “prime vendor contract,” or similar procurement document bearing a priority rating contains no specific delivery date or dates, but provides for the furnishing of items from time-to-time or within a stated period against specific purchase orders, such as “calls,” “requisitions,” and “delivery orders,” the purchase orders under such contracts or agreements must specify a required delivery date or dates and are to be considered as rated as of the date of their receipt by the supplier and not as of the date of the original procurement document.
</P>
<P>(3) The written signature on a manually placed order, or the digital signature or name on an electronically placed order, of an individual authorized to sign rated orders for the person placing the order.

<HEAD>§ 333.13   Acceptance and rejection of rated orders.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Mandatory acceptance.</I> (1) Except as otherwise specified in this section, a person must accept every rated order received and must fill such orders regardless of any other rated or unrated orders that have been accepted.
</P>
<P>(2) A person must not discriminate against rated orders in any manner such as by charging higher prices or by imposing different terms and conditions than for comparable unrated orders.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Mandatory rejection.</I> Unless otherwise directed by FEMA:
</P>
<P>(1) A person must not accept a rated order for delivery on a specific date if unable to fill the order by that date. However, the person must inform the customer of the earliest date on which delivery can be made and offer to accept the order on the basis of that date. Scheduling conflicts with previously accepted lower rated or unrated orders are not sufficient reason for rejection under this section.
</P>
<P>(2) A person must not accept a DO rated order for delivery on a date which would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DO or DX rated orders. However, the person must offer to accept the order based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.
</P>
<P>(3) A person must not accept a DX rated order for delivery on a date which would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DX rated orders, but must offer to accept the order based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.
</P>
<P>(4) If a person is unable to fill all the rated orders of equal priority status received on the same day, the person must accept, based upon the earliest delivery dates, only those orders which can be filled, and reject the other orders. For example, a person must accept order A requiring delivery on December 15 before accepting order B requiring delivery on December 31. However, the person must offer to accept the rejected orders based on the earliest delivery dates otherwise possible.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Optional rejection.</I> Unless otherwise directed by FEMA, rated orders may be rejected in any of the following cases as long as a supplier does not discriminate among customers:
</P>
<P>(1) If the person placing the order is unwilling or unable to meet regularly established terms of sale or payment;
</P>
<P>(2) If the order is for an item not supplied or for a service not performed;
</P>
<P>(3) If the order is for an item produced, acquired, or provided only for the supplier's own use for which no orders have been filled for two years prior to the date of receipt of the rated order. If, however, a supplier has sold some of these items, the supplier is obligated to accept rated orders up to that quantity or portion of production, whichever is greater, sold within the past two years;
</P>
<P>(4) If the person placing the rated order, other than the Federal Government, makes the item or performs the service being ordered;
</P>
<P>(5) If acceptance of a rated order or performance against a rated order would violate any other regulation, official action, or order of FEMA issued under the authority of the Defense Production Act or another relevant statute.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Customer notification requirements.</I> (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a person must accept or reject a rated order in written electronic format within 15 working days after receipt of a DO rated order and within 10 working days after receipt of a DX rated order. If the order is rejected, the person must give reasons in written electronic format for the rejection.
</P>
<P>(2) If a rated order is placed for the purpose of emergency preparedness requirements and expedited action is necessary or appropriate to meet these requirements and the order includes the statement set forth in § 333.12(b), a person must accept or reject the rated order and transmit the acceptance or rejection in written electronic format within the time specified in the rated order. The minimum times for acceptance or rejection that such orders may specify are 6 hours after receipt of the order if the order is issued by an authorized person in response to a hazard that has occurred, or 12 hours after receipt if the order is issued by an authorized person to prepare for an imminent hazard.
</P>
<P>(3) If a person has accepted a rated order and subsequently finds that shipment or performance will be delayed, the person must notify the customer immediately, give the reasons for the delay, and advise of a new shipment or performance date. If notification is given verbally, written electronic confirmation must be provided within 24 hours of the verbal notice.

<HEAD>§ 333.14   Preferential scheduling.</HEAD>
<P>(a) A person must schedule operations, including the acquisition of all needed production items, in a timely manner to satisfy the delivery requirements of each rated order. Modifying production or delivery schedules is necessary only when required delivery dates for rated orders cannot otherwise be met.
</P>
<P>(b) DO rated orders must be given production preference over unrated orders, if necessary, to meet required delivery dates, even if this requires the diversion of items being processed or ready for delivery against unrated orders. Similarly, DX rated orders must be given preference over DO rated orders and unrated orders.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Examples:</I> If a person receives a DO rated order with a delivery date of June 3 and if meeting that date would mean delaying production or delivery of an item for an unrated order, the unrated order must be delayed. If a DX rated order is received calling for delivery on July 15 and a person has a DO rated order requiring delivery on June 2 and operations can be scheduled to meet both deliveries, there is no need to alter production schedules to give any additional preference to the DX rated order. However, if business operations cannot be altered to meet both the June 3 and July 15 delivery dates, then the DX rated order must be given priority over the DO rated order.
</P>
<P>(2) [Reserved]
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Conflicting rated orders.</I> (1) If a person finds that delivery or performance against any accepted rated orders conflicts with the delivery or performance against other accepted rated orders of equal priority status, the person must give preference to the conflicting orders in the sequence in which they are to be delivered or performed (not to the receipt dates). If the conflicting rated orders are scheduled to be delivered or performed on the same day, the person must give preference to those orders which have the earliest receipt dates.
</P>
<P>(2) If a person is unable to resolve rated order delivery or performance conflicts under this section, the person should promptly seek special priorities assistance as provided in subpart E of this part. If the person's customer objects to the rescheduling of delivery or performance of a rated order, the customer should promptly seek special priorities assistance as provided in subpart E of this part. For any rated order against which delivery or performance will be delayed, the person must notify the customer as provided in § 333.13(d)(3).
</P>
<P>(d) If a person is unable to purchase needed production items in time to fill a rated order by its required delivery date, the person must fill the rated order by using inventoried production items. A person who uses inventoried items to fill a rated order may replace those items with the use of a rated order as provided in § 333.17(b).

<P>(c) An amendment to a rated order that significantly alters a supplier's original production or delivery schedule shall constitute a new rated order as of the date of its receipt. The supplier must accept or reject the amended order according to the provisions of § 333.13.
</P>
<P>(d) The following amendments do not constitute a new rated order: A change in shipping destination; A reduction in the total amount of the order; an increase in the total amount of the order which has negligible impact upon deliveries; a minor variation in size or design (prior to the start of production); or a change which is agreed upon between the supplier and the customer.

<HEAD>§ 333.21   Requests for priority rating authority.</HEAD>
<P>(a) If a rated order is likely to be delayed because a person is unable to obtain items not normally rated under this part, the person may request the authority to use a priority rating in ordering the needed items.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Rating authority for production or construction equipment.</I> (1) A request for priority rating authority for production or construction equipment, if needed, must be submitted to the U.S. Department of Commerce on Form BIS-999.
</P>
<P>(2) When the use of a priority rating is authorized for the procurement of production or construction equipment, a rated order may be used either to purchase or to lease such equipment. However, in the latter case, the equipment may be leased only from a person engaged in the business of leasing such equipment or from a person willing to lease rather than sell.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract.</I> (1) In certain cases, and upon specific request, FEMA, in order to promote the national defense, may authorize a person to place a priority rating on an order to a supplier in advance of the issuance of a rated prime contract. In these instances, the person requesting advance rating authority must obtain sponsorship of the request from FEMA or the appropriate Delegate Agency. The person shall also assume any business risk associated with the placing of rated orders if these orders have to be cancelled in the event the rated prime contract is not issued.
</P>
<P>(2) The person must state the following in the request: “It is understood that the authorization of a priority rating in advance of our receiving a rated prime contract from FEMA (or a Delegate Agency) and our use of that priority rating with our suppliers in no way commits the Delegate Agency, FEMA, or any other Federal Government agency to enter into a contract or order or to expend funds. Further, we understand that the Federal Government shall not be liable for any cancellation charges, termination costs, or other damages that may accrue if a rated prime contract is not eventually placed and, as a result, we must subsequently cancel orders placed with the use of the priority rating authorized as a result of this request.”
</P>
<P>(3) In reviewing requests for rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract, FEMA will consider, among other things, the following criteria:
</P>
<P>(i) The probability that the prime contract will be awarded;
</P>
<P>(ii) The impact of the resulting rated orders on suppliers and on other authorized programs;
</P>
<P>(iii) Whether the contractor is the sole source;
</P>
<P>(iv) Whether the item being produced has a long lead time; and
</P>
<P>(v) The time period for which the rating is being requested.
</P>
<P>(4) FEMA may require periodic reports on the use of the rating authority granted under paragraph (c) of this section.
</P>
<P>(5) If a rated prime contract is not issued, the person must promptly notify all suppliers who have received rated orders pursuant to the advance rating authority that the priority rating on those orders is cancelled.

</P>
<P>(d) The production of books, records, documents, other writings and information will not be required at any place other than where they are usually kept if, prior to the return date specified in the administrative subpoena or demand for information, a duly authorized official of FEMA is furnished with copies of such material that are certified under oath to be true copies. As an alternative, a person may enter into a stipulation with a duly authorized official of FEMA as to the content of the material.
</P>
<P>(e) An administrative subpoena, demand for information, or inspection authorization must include the name, title, or official position of the person to be served, the evidence sought to be adduced, and its general relevance to the scope and purpose of the audit, investigation, or other inquiry. If employees or agents are to be interviewed; if books, records, documents, other writings, or information are to be produced; or if property is to be inspected; the administrative subpoena, demand for information, or inspection authorization will describe them with particularity.
</P>
<P>(f) Service of documents must be made in the following manner:
</P>
<P>(1) Service of a demand for information or inspection authorization must be made personally, or by certified mail—return receipt requested at the person's last known address. Service of an administrative subpoena must be made personally. Personal service may also be made by leaving a copy of the document with someone at least 18 years of age at the person's last known dwelling or place of business. When a hazard has occurred or is imminent, service of a demand for information or inspection authorization may additionally be made by written electronic communication.
</P>
<P>(2) Service upon other than an individual may be made by serving a partner, corporate officer, or a managing or general agent authorized by appointment or by law to accept service of process. If an agent is served, a copy of the document must be mailed to the person named in the document.
</P>
<P>(3) Any individual 18 years of age or older may serve an administrative subpoena, demand for information, or inspection authorization. When personal service is made, the individual making the service shall prepare an affidavit as to the manner in which service was made and the identity of the person served, and return the affidavit, and in the case of subpoenas, the original document, to the issuing officer. In case of failure to make service, the reasons for the failure must be stated on the original document.

</P>
<P>(b) Establishes a Graduated Mobilization Response (GMR) system for developing and implementing mobilization actions that are responsive to a wide range of national security threats and ambiguous or specific warning indicators. GMR provides for a coherent decision making process with which to proceed with specific responses to an identified crisis or emergency.
</P>

<HEAD>§ 334.2   Policy.</HEAD>
<P>(a) As established in Executive Order 12656, the policy of the United States is to have sufficient emergency response capabilities at all levels of government to meet essential defense and civilian needs during any national security emergency. Accordingly, each Federal department and agency shall prepare its national security emergency preparedness plans and programs to respond adequately and in a timely manner to all national security emergencies.
</P>
<P>(b) As part of emergency response, the GMR system should be incorporated in each department's and agency's emergency preparedness plans and programs to provide appropriate and effective response options for consideration in reacting to ambiguous and specific warnings.
</P>
<P>(c) Departments and agencies will be provided early warning information developed by the intelligence community and policy statements of the President.
</P>
<P>(d) Emergency resource preparedness planning is essential to ensure that the nation is adequately prepared to respond to potential national emergencies. Such emergency resource preparedness planning requires an exchange of information and planning factors among the various departments and agencies responsible for different resource preparedness actitivities.
</P>
<P>(e) To carry out their emergency planning activities, civilian departments and agencies require the Department of Defense's (DOD) assessment of potential military demands that would be made on the economy in a full range of possible national security emergencies. Similarly, DOD planning should be conducted using planning regimes consistent with the policies and plans of the civilian resource departments and agencies.
</P>
<P>(f) Under section 104(c) of Executive Order 12656, FEMA is responsible for coordinating the implementation of national emergency preparedness policy with Federal departments and agencies and with state and local governments and, therefore, is responsible for developing a system of planning procedures for integrating the emergency preparedness actions of federal, state and local governments.
</P>
<P>(g) Federal departments and agencies shall design their preparedness measures to permit a rapid and effective transition from routine to emergency operations, and to make effective use of the period following initial indication of a probable national security emergency. This will include:
</P>
<P>(1) Development of a system of emergency actions that defines alternatives, processes, and issues to be considered during various stages of national security emergencies; and
</P>
<P>(2) Identification of actions that could be taken at the Federal and local levels of government in the early stages of a national security emergency or pending national security emergency to mitigate the impact of or reduce significantly the leadtime associated with full emergency action implementation.

<DIV8 N="§ 334.3" NODE="44:1.0.1.6.82.0.10.3" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 334.3   Background.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The GMR system is designed to take into account the need to mobilize the Nation's resources in response to a wide range of crisis or emergency situations. GMR is a flexible decision making process of preparedness and response actions which are appropriate to warning indicators or an event. Thus, GMR allows the government, as a whole, to take small or large, often reversible, steps to increase its national security emergency preparedness posture.
</P>
<P>(b) Crises, especially those resulting in major military activities, always have some political or economic context. As the risks of military action increase, nations undertake more extensive preparations over a longer period of time to increase their military power. Such preparations by potential adversaries shape the nature and gravity of the threat as well as its likelihood and timing of occurrence. These measures permit the development of reliable indicators of threat at an early time in the evolution of a crisis. Depending on the nature of the situation or event and the nation involved, these early warning indicators may emanate from the political, socio-economic and/or industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>(c) The GMR system enables the nation to approach mobilization planning and actions as part of the deterrent response capability and to use it to reduce the probability of conflict. Alternatively, if deterrence should fail, the GMR system would enable the nation to undertake a series of phased actions intended to increase its ability to meet defense and essential civilian requirements. The GMR system integrates the potential strength of the national economy into U.S. national security strategy.

<HEAD>§ 334.4   Definitions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Graduated Mobilization Response</I> (GMR) is a system for integrating mobilization actions designed to respond to ambiguous and/or specific warnings. These actions are designed to mitigate the impact of an event or crisis and reduce significantly the lead time associated with a full national emergency action implementation.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>National security emergency</I> is any occurrence, including natural disaster, military attack, technological emergency, or other emergency, that seriously degrades or threatens the national security of the United States.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Mobilization</I> is the process of marshalling resources, both civil and military, to respond to and manage a national security emergency.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>GMR Plans</I> are those agency documents that describe, in general, the actions that an agency could take in the early stages of a national security emergency, or upon receipt of warning information about a possible national security emergency. These actions would be designed to mitigate the impact of, or reduce significantly, the lead times associated with full emergency action implementation. Such plans are required by section 201(4)(b) of Executive Order 12656.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>A Costed Option Package</I> is a document that describes in detail a particular action that an agency could take in the early stages of a national security emergency.

<HEAD>§ 334.5   GMR system description.</HEAD>
<P>The GMR system contains three stages of mobilization activity (additional intermediate GMR stages may be developed). For example, a Federal department or agency might divide “Crisis Management” into two, three, or more levels as suits its needs.
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Stage 3, Planning and Preparation.</I> During the planning and preparation stage, Federal departments and agencies develop their GMR plans and maintain capability to carry out their mobilization-related responsibilities in accordance with section 201 of Executive Order 12656. General types of problems likely to arise in a crisis situation are identified along with possible methods for dealing with them. Investment programs can be undertaken to overcome identified problems.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Stage 2, Crisis Management.</I> During the crisis management stage, GMR plans are reviewed and capabilities will be re-examined in light of an actual event or crisis perceived to be emerging.
</P>
<P>(1) Federal departments and agencies may need to gather additional data on selected resources or increase their preparedness activities. Costed Option Packages may need to be updated or new ones prepared for the response option measures in each of the department's and agency's area of responsibility. For example, when it appears likely that increased national resources may be required, resource readiness could be improved through the procurement of essential long lead time items, especially those that can be used even if the situation does not escalate. In general, long lead time preparedness actions would be considered for implementation at this time.
</P>
<P>(2) Many preparedness actions at this stage would be handled through reprogramming, but the Costed Option Packages may also require new funding.
</P>
<P>(3) If the crisis worsens, and prior to the declaration of national emergency, it may be necessary to surge certain production and stockpile items for future use.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Stage 1, National Emergency/War.</I> During a national emergency or declaration of war, mobilization of all national resources escalates and GMR will be subsumed into the overall mobilization effort. As military requirements increase, the national resources would increasingly be focused on the national security emergency. This would involve diverting non-essential demand for scarce resources from peacetime to defense uses, and converting industry from commercial to military production. Both surge production and expansion of the nation's productive capacity may also be necessary. Supplemental appropriations may be required for most Federal departments and agencies having national security emergency responsibilities.

<HEAD>§ 334.6   Department and agency responsibilities.</HEAD>
<P>(a) During Stage 3, each Federal department and agency with mobilization responsibilities will develop GMR plans as part of its emergency preparedness planning process in order to meet possible future crisis. Costed Option Packages will be developed for actions that may be necessary in the early warning period. Option packages will be reviewed, focused and refined during Stage 2 to meet the particular emergency.
</P>
<P>(b) Each department and agency should identify response actions appropriate for the early stage of any crisis or emergency situation, which then will be reviewed, focused and refined in Stage 2 for execution, as appropriate. GMR plans should contain a menu of costed option packages that provide details of alternative measures that may be used in an emergency situation.
</P>
<P>(c) FEMA will provide guidance pursuant to Executive Order 12656 and will coordinate GMR plans and option packages of DOD and the civilian departments and agencies to ensure consistency and to identify areas where additional planning or investment is needed.
</P>
<P>(d) During State 2, FEMA will coordinate department and agency recommendations for action and forward them to the National Security Advisor to make certain that consistency with the overall national strategy planning is achieved.
</P>
<P>(e) Departments and agencies will refine their GMR plans to focus on the specific crisis situation. Costed option packages should be refined to identify the resources necessary for the current crisis, action taken to obtain those resources, and GMR plans implemented consistent with the seriousness of the crisis.
</P>
<P>(f) At Stage 1, declaration of national emergency or war, the crisis is under the control of NSC or other central authority, with GMR being integrated into partial, full or total mobilization. At this point the more traditional mechanisms of resource mobilization are pursued, focusing on resource allocation and adjudication with cognizance of the essential civilian demand.
</P>
<P>(g) Programs and plans developed by the departments and agencies under this guidance should be shared, as appropriate, with States, local governments and the private sector to provide a baseline for their development of supporting programs and plans.

<HEAD>§ 350.3   Background.</HEAD>
<P>(a) On December 7, 1979, the President directed the Administrator of FEMA to take the lead in State and local emergency planning and preparedness activities with respect to nuclear power facilities. This included a review of the existing emergency plans both in States with operating reactors and those with plants scheduled for operation in the near future.
</P>
<P>(b) This assignment was given to FEMA because of its responsibilities under Executive Order 12148 to establish Federal policies for and coordinate civil emergency planning, management and assistance functions and to represent the President in working with State and local governments and the private sector to stimulate vigorous participation in civil emergency preparedness programs. Under section 201 of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5131), and other statutory functions, the Administrator of FEMA is charged with the responsibility to develop and implement plans and programs of disaster preparedness.
</P>
<P>(c) There are two sections in the NRC's fiscal year 1982/1983 Appropriation Authorization (Pub. L. 97-415) that pertain to the scope of this rule.
</P>
<P>(1) Section 5 provides for the issuance of an operating license for a commercial nuclear power plant by the NRC if it is determined that there exists a State, local or utility plan which provides assurance that public health and safety is not endangered by the operation of the facility. This section would allow the NRC to issue an operating license for such plants without FEMA-approved State and local government plans.
</P>
<P>(2) Section 11 provides for the issuance of temporary licenses for operating a utilization facility at a specific power level to be determined by the Commission, pending final action by the Commission on the application. Also, this section authorizes the NRC to issue temporary operating licenses for these facilities without the completion of the required (NRC) Commission hearing process. A petition for such a temporary license may not be filed until certain actions are completed including the submission of a State, local or utility emergency response plan for the facility.
</P>
<P>(d) To carry out these responsibilities, FEMA is engaged in a cooperative effort with State and local governments and other Federal agencies in the development of State and local plans and preparedness to cope with the offsite effects resulting from radiological emergencies at commercial nuclear power facilities. FEMA developed and published the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan 50 FR 46542 Nov. 8, 1985, to provide the overall support to State and local governments, for all types of radiological incidents including those occurring at nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>(e) FEMA has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the NRC to which it will furnish assessments, findings and determinations as to whether State and local emergency plans and preparedness are adequate and continue to be capable of implementation (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualification and equipment adequacy). These findings and determinations will be used by NRC under its own rules in connection with its licensing and regulatory requirements and FEMA will support its findings in the NRC licensing process and related court proceedings.
</P>
<P>(f) Notwithstanding the procedures set forth in these rules for requesting and reaching a FEMA administrative approval of State and local plans, findings and determinations on the current status of emergency preparedness around particular sites may be requested by the NRC and provided by FEMA for use as needed in the NRC licensing process. These findings and determinations may be based upon plans currently available to FEMA or furnished to FEMA by the NRC through the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee.
</P>
<P>(g) An environmental assessment has been prepared on which FEMA has determined that this rule will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.

<HEAD>§ 350.5   Criteria for review and approval of State and local radiological emergency plans and preparedness.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Section 50.47 of NRC's Emergency Planning Rule (10 CFR parts 50 (appendix E) and 70 as amended) and the joint FEMA-NRC <I>Criteria for Preparation and Evaluation of Radiological Emergency Response Plans and Preparedness in Support of Nuclear Power Plants</I> (NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1, November 1980) which apply insofar as FEMA is concerned to State and local governments, are to be used in reviewing, evaluating and approving State and local radiological emergency plans and preparedness and in making any findings and determinations with respect to the adequacy of the plans and the capabilities of State and local governments to implement them. Both the planning and preparedness standards and related criteria contained in NUREG-0654/ FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1 are to be used by FEMA and the NRC in reviewing and evaluating State and local government radiological emergency plans and preparedness. For brevity, only the planning standards contained in NUREG-0654/ FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1 are presented below.
</P>
<P>(1) Primary responsibilities for emergency response by the nuclear facility licensee, and by State and local organizations within the Emergency Planning Zones have been assigned, the emergency responsibilities of the various supporting organizations have been specifically established and each principal response organization has staff to respond to and augment its initial response on a continuous basis.
</P>
<P>(2) On-shift facility licensee responsibilities for emergency response are unambiguously defined, adequate staffing to provide initial facility accident response in key functional areas is maintained at all times, timely augmentation of response capabilities is available and the interfaces among various onsite response activities and offsite support and response activities are specified. (This standard applies only to NRC licensees but is included here for completeness.)
</P>
<P>(3) Arrangements for requesting and effectively using assistance resources have been made, arrangements to accommodate State and local staff at the licensee's near-site Emergency Operations Facility have been made and other organizations capable of augmenting the planned response have been identified.
</P>
<P>(4) A standard emergency classification and action level scheme, the bases of which include facility system and effluent parameters, is in use by the nuclear facility licensee, and State and local response plans call for reliance on information provided by facility licensees for determinations of minimum initial offsite response measures.
</P>
<P>(5) Procedures have been established for notification, by the licensee, of State and local response organizations and for the notification of emergency personnel by all response organizations; the content of initial and followup messages to response organizations and the public has been established; and means to provide early notification and clear instruction to the populace within the plume exposure pathway Emergency Planning Zone have been established.
</P>
<P>(6) Provisions exist for prompt communications among principal response organizations to emergency personnel and to the public.
</P>
<P>(7) Information is made available to the public on a periodic basis on how they will be notified and what their initial actions should be in an emergency (e.g., listening to a local broadcast station and remaining indoors), the principal points of contact with the news media for dissemination of information during an emergency (including the physical location or locations) are established in advance and procedures for coordinated dissemination of information to the public are established.
</P>
<P>(8) Adequate emergency facilities and equipment to support the emergency response are provided and maintained.
</P>
<P>(9) Adequate methods, systems and equipment for assessing and monitoring actual or potential offsite consequences of a radiological emergency condition are in use.
</P>
<P>(10) A range of protective actions has been developed for the plume exposure pathway EPZ for emergency workers and the public. Guidelines for the choice of protective actions during an emergency, consistent with Federal guidance, are developed and in place and protective actions for the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ appropriate to the locale have been developed.
</P>
<P>(11) Means for controlling radiological exposures, in an emergency, are established for emergency workers. The means for controlling radiological exposures shall include exposure guidelines consistent with EPA Emergency Worker and Lifesaving Activity Protective Action Guides.
</P>
<P>(12) Arrangements are made for medical services for contaminated injured individuals.
</P>
<P>(13) General plans for recovery and reentry are developed.
</P>
<P>(14) Periodic exercises are (will be) conducted to evaluate major portions of emergency response capabilities, periodic drills are (will be) conducted to develop and maintain key skills and deficiencies identified as a result of exercises or drills are (will be) corrected.
</P>
<P>(15) Radiological emergency response training is provided to those who may be called upon to assist in an emergency.
</P>
<P>(16) Responsibilities for plan development and review and for distribution of emergency plans are established, and planners are properly trained.
</P>
<P>(b) In order for State of local plans and preparedness to be approved, such plans and preparedness must be determined to adequately protect the public health and safety by providing reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken offsite in the event of a radiological emergency.

<HEAD>§ 350.6   Assistance in development of State and local plans.</HEAD>
<P>(a) An integrated approach to the development of offsite radiological emergency plans by States, localities and the licensees of NRC with the assistance of the Federal Government is the approach most likely to provide the best protection to the public. Hence, Federal agencies, including FEMA Regional staff, will be made available upon request to assist States and localities in the development of plans.
</P>
<P>(b) There now exists in each of the ten standard Federal Regions a Regional Assistance Committee (RAC) (formerly the Regional Advisory Committee) chaired by a FEMA Regional official and having members from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Department of Agriculture and Department of Commerce. Whereas in 44 CFR part 351, the Department of Defense is listed as a potential member of the RACs, it is not listed in this rule because military nuclear facilities are not the subject of concern. The RACs will assist State and local government officials in the development of their radiological emergency response plans, and will review plans and observe exercises to evaluate the adequacy of these plans and related preparedness. This assistance does not include the actual writing of State and local government plans by RAC members.
</P>
<P>(c) In accomplishing the foregoing, the RACs will use the standards and criteria in NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1, and will render such technical assistance as may be required, appropriate to their agency mission and expertise. In observing and evaluating exercises, the RACs will identify, soon after an exercise, any deficiencies observed in the planning and preparedness effort including deficiencies in resources, training of staff, equipment, staffing levels and deficiencies in the qualifications of personnel.

<HEAD>§ 350.7   Application by State for review and approval.</HEAD>
<P>(a) A State which seeks formal review and approval by FEMA of the State's radiological emergency plan shall submit an application for such review and approval to the FEMA Regional Administrator of the Region in which the State is located. The application, in the form of a letter from the Governor or from such other State official as the Governor may designate, shall contain one copy of the completed State plan, including coverage of response in the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ. The application will also include plans of all appropriate local governments. The application shall specify the site or sites for which plan approval is sought. For guidance on the local government plans that should be included with an application, refer to Part I.E. NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, Rev. 1, entitled Contiguous Jurisdiction Governmental Emergency Planning (see (e)). Only a State may request formal review of State or local radiological emergency plans.
</P>
<P>(b) Generally, the plume exposure pathway EPZ for nuclear power facilities shall consist of an area about 10 miles (16 Km) in radius and the ingestion exposure pathway EPZ shall consist of an area about 50 miles (80 Km) in radius. The exact size and configuration of the EPZs surrounding a particular nuclear power facility shall be determined by State and local governments in consultation with FEMA and NRC taking into account such local conditions as demography, topography, land characteristics, access routes and local jurisdiction boundaries. The size of the EPZs may be determined by NRC in consultation with FEMA on a case-by-case basis for gas cooled reactors and for reactors with an authorized power level less than 250 Mw thermal. The plans for the ingestion exposure pathway shall focus on such actions as are appropriate to protect the public from ingesting contaminated food and water.
</P>
<P>(c) A State may submit separately its plans for the EPZs and the local government plans related to individual nuclear power facilities. The purpose of separate submissions is to allow approval of a State plan, and of the plans necessary for specific nuclear power facilities in a multiple-facility State, while not approving or acting on the plans necessary for other nuclear power facilities within the State. If separate submissions are made, appropriate adjustments in the State plan may be necessary. In any event, FEMA approval of State plans and appropriate local government plans shall be site specific.
</P>
<P>(d) The applications shall contain a statement that the State plan, together with the appropriate local plans, is, in the opinion of the State, adequate to protect the public health and safety of its citizens living within the emergency planning zones for the nuclear power facilities included in the submission by providing reasonable assurance that State and local governments can and intend to effect appropriate protective measures offsite in the event of a radiological emergency.

<HEAD>Appendix A to Part 353—Memorandum of Understanding Between Federal Emergency Management Agency and Nuclear Regulatory Commission
</HEAD>
<P>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have entered into a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Relating to Radiological Emergency Planning and Preparedness. This supersedes a memorandum entered into on November 1, 1980 (published December 16, 1980, 45 FR 82713), revised April 9, 1985 (published April 18, 1985, 50 FR 15485), and published as Appendix A to 44 CFR part 353. The substantive changes in the new MOU are: (1) Self-initiated review by the NRC; (2) Early Site Permit process; (3) adoption of FEMA exercise time-frames; (4) incorporation of FEMA definition of exercise deficiency; (5) NRC commitment to work with licensees in support of State and local governments to correct exercise deficiencies; (6) correlation of FEMA actions on withdrawal of approvals under 44 CFR part 350 and NRC enforcement actions; and (7) disaster-initiated reviews in situations that affect offsite emergency infrastructures. The text of the MOU follows.
</P>
<HD1>Memorandum of Understanding Between NRC and FEMA Relating to Radiological Emergency Planning and Preparedness
</HD1>
<HD2>I. Background and Purposes
</HD2>
<P>This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) establishes a framework of cooperation between the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in radiological emergency response planning matters so that their mutual efforts will be directed toward more effective plans and related preparedness measures at and in the vicinity of nuclear reactors and fuel cycle facilities which are subject to 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, and certain other fuel cycle and materials licensees which have potential for significant accidental offsite radiological releases. The memorandum is responsive to the President's decision of December 7, 1979, that FEMA will take the lead in offsite planning and response, his request that NRC assist FEMA in carrying out this role, and the NRC's continuing statutory responsibility for the radiological health and safety of the public.
</P>
<P>On January 14, 1980, the two agencies entered into a “Memorandum of Understanding Between NRC and FEMA to Accomplish a Prompt Improvement in Radiological Emergency Preparedness,” that was responsive to the President's December 7, 1979, statement. A revised and updated Memorandum of Understanding became effective November 1, 1980. The MOU was further revised and updated on April 9, 1985. This MOU is a further revision to reflect the evolving relationship between NRC and FEMA and the experience gained in carrying out the provisions of the previous MOU's. This MOU supersedes these two earlier versions of the MOU.
</P>
<P>The general principles agreed to in the previous MOU's and reaffirmed in this MOU, are as follows: FEMA coordinates all Federal planning for the offsite impact of radiological emergencies and takes the lead for assessing offsite radiological emergency response plans 
<SU>1</SU>
<FTREF/> and preparedness, makes findings and determinations as to the adequacy and capability of implementing offsite plans, and communicates those findings and determinations to the NRC. The NRC reviews those FEMA findings and determinations in conjunction with the NRC onsite findings for the purpose of making determinations on the overall state of emergency preparedness. These overall findings and determinations are used by NRC to make radiological health and safety decisions in the issuance of licenses and the continued operation of licensed plants to include taking enforcement actions as notices of violations, civil penalties, orders, or shutdown of operating reactors. This delineation of responsibilities avoids duplicative efforts by the NRC staff in offsite preparedness matters. However, if FEMA informs the NRC that an emergency, unforeseen contingency, or other reason would prevent FEMA from providing a requested finding in a reasonable time, then, in consultation with FEMA, the NRC might initiate its own review of offsite emergency preparedness.
</P>
<FTNT>
<P>
<SU>1</SU> Assessments of offsite plans may be based on State and local government plans submitted to FEMA under its rule (44 CFR Part 350), and as noted in 44 CFR 350.3(f), may also be based on plans currently available to FEMA or furnished to FEMA through the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee.</P></FTNT>
<P>A separate MOU dated October 22, 1980, deals with NRC/FEMA cooperation and responsibilities in response to an actual or potential radiological emergency. Operations Response Procedures have been developed that implement the provisions of the Incident Response MOU. These documents are intended to be consistent with the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan which describes the relationships, roles, and responsibilities of Federal Agencies for responding to accidents involving peacetime nuclear emergencies. On December 1, 1991, the NRC and FEMA also concluded a separate MOU in support of Executive Order 12657 (FEMA Assistance in Emergency Preparedness Planning at Commercial Nuclear Power Plants).
</P>
<HD2>II. Authorities and Responsibilities
</HD2>
<P>FEMA-Executive Order 12148 charges the Director, FEMA, with the responsibility to “* * * establish Federal policies for, and coordinate, all civil defense and civil emergency planning, management, mitigation, and assistance functions of Executive agencies” (Section 2-101) and “* * * represent the President in working with State and local governments and the private sector to stimulate vigorous participation in civil emergency preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery programs” (Section 2-104.).
</P>
<P>On December 7, 1979, the President, in response to the recommendations of the Kemeny Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island, directed that FEMA assume lead responsibility for all offsite nuclear emergency planning and response.
</P>
<P>Specifically, the FEMA responsibilities with respect to radiological emergency preparedness as they relate to NRC are:
</P>
<P>1. To take the lead in offsite emergency planning and to review and assess offsite emergency plans and preparedness for adequacy.
</P>
<P>2. To make findings and determinations as to whether offsite emergency plans are adequate and can be implemented (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualifications, and equipment). Notwithstanding the procedures which are set forth in 44 CFR part 350 for requesting and reaching a FEMA administrative approval of State and local plans, findings, and determinations on the current status of emergency planning and preparedness around particular sites, referred to as interim findings, will be provided by FEMA for use as needed in the NRC licensing process. Such findings will be provided by FEMA on mutually agreed to schedules or on specific NRC request. The request and findings will normally be by written communications between the co-chairs of the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee. An interim finding provided under this arrangement will be an extension of FEMA's procedures for review and approval of offsite radiological emergency plans and preparedness set forth in 44 CFR part 350. It will be based on the review of currently available plans and, if appropriate, joint exercise results related to a specific nuclear power plant site.
</P>
<P>If the review involves an application under 10 CFR part 52 for an early site permit, the NRC will forward to FEMA pertinent information provided by the applicant and consult with FEMA as to whether there is any significant impediment to the development of offsite emergency plans. As appropriate, depending upon the nature of information provided by the applicant, the NRC will also request that FEMA determine whether major features of offsite emergency plans submitted by the applicant are acceptable, or whether offsite emergency plans submitted by the applicant are adequate, as discussed below.
</P>
<P>An interim finding based only on the review of currently available offsite plans will include an assessment as to whether these plans are adequate when measured against the standards and criteria of NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1, and, pending a demonstration through an exercise, whether there is reasonable assurance that the plans can be implemented. The finding will indicate one of the following conditions: (1) Plans are adequate and there is reasonable assurance that they can be implemented with only limited or no corrections needed; (2) plans are adequate, but before a determination can be made as to whether they can be implemented, corrections must be made to the plans or supporting measures must be demonstrated (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualifications, and equipment) or (3) plans are inadequate and cannot be implemented until they are revised to correct deficiencies noted in the Federal review.
</P>
<P>If, in FEMA's view, the plans that are available are not completed or are not ready for review, FEMA will provide NRC with a status report delineating milestones for preparation of the plan by the offsite authorities as well as FEMA's actions to assist in timely development and review of the plans.
</P>
<P>An interim finding on preparedness will be based on review of currently available plans and joint exercise results and will include an assessment as to (1) whether offsite emergency plans are adequate as measured against the standards and criteria of NUREG-0654/FEMA-REP-1 and (2) whether the exercise(s) demonstrated that there is reasonable assurance that the plans can be implemented.
</P>
<P>An interim finding on preparedness will indicate one of the following conditions: (1) There is reasonable assurance that the plans are adequate and can be implemented as demonstrated in an exercise; (2) there are deficiencies that must be corrected; or (3) FEMA is undecided and will provide a schedule of actions leading to a decision.
</P>
<P>3. To assume responsibility, as a supplement to State, local, and utility efforts, for radiological emergency preparedness training of State and local officials.
</P>
<P>4. To develop and issue an updated series of interagency assignments which delineate respective agency capabilities and responsibilities and define procedures for coordination and direction for emergency planning and response. [Current assignments are in 44 CFR part 351, March 11, 1982. (47 FR 10758)]
</P>
<P>NRC-The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, requires that the NRC grant licenses only if the health and safety of the public is adequately protected. While the Atomic Energy Act does not specifically require emergency plans and related preparedness measures, the NRC requires consideration of overall emergency preparedness as a part of the licensing process. The NRC rules (10 CFR 50.33, 50.34, 50.47, 50.54, and appendix E to 10 CFR part 50, and 10 CFR part 52) include requirements for the licensee's emergency plans.
</P>
<P>Specifically, the NRC responsibilities for radiological emergency preparedness are:
</P>
<P>1. To assess licensee emergency plans for adequacy. This review will include organizations with whom licensees have written agreements to provide onsite support services under emergency conditions.
</P>
<P>2. To verify that licensee emergency plans are adequately implemented (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualifications, and equipment).
</P>
<P>3. To review the FEMA findings and determinations as to whether offsite plans are adequate and can be implemented.
</P>
<P>4. To make radiological health and safety decisions with regard to the overall state of emergency preparedness (i.e., integration of emergency preparedness onsite as determined by the NRC and offsite as determined by FEMA and reviewed by NRC) such as assurance for continued operation, for issuance of operating licenses, or for taking enforcement actions, such as notices of violations, civil penalties, orders, or shutdown of operating reactors.
</P>
<HD2>III. Areas of Cooperation
</HD2>
<HD3>A. NRC Licensing Reviews
</HD3>
<P>FEMA will provide support to the NRC for licensing reviews related to reactors, fuel facilities, and materials licensees with regard to the assessment of the adequacy of offsite radiological emergency response plans and preparedness. This will include timely submittal of an evaluation suitable for inclusion in NRC safety evaluation reports.
</P>
<P>Substantially prior to the time that a FEMA evaluation is required with regard to fuel facility or materials license review, NRC will identify those fuel and materials licensees with potential for significant accidental offsite radiological releases and transmit a request for review to FEMA as the emergency plans are completed.
</P>
<P>FEMA routine support will include providing assessments, findings and determinations (interim and final) on offsite plans and preparedness related to reactor license reviews. To support its findings and determinations, FEMA will make expert witnesses available before the Commission, the NRC Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, NRC hearing boards and administrative law judges, for any court actions, and during any related discovery proceedings.
</P>
<P>FEMA will appear in NRC licensing proceedings as part of the presentation of the NRC staff. FEMA counsel will normally present FEMA witnesses and be permitted, at the discretion of the NRC licensing board, to cross-examine the witnesses of parties, other than the NRC witnesses, on matters involving FEMA findings and determinations, policies, or operations; however, FEMA will not be asked to testify on status reports. FEMA is not a party to NRC proceedings and, therefore, is not subject to formal discovery requirements placed upon parties to NRC proceedings. Consistent with available resources, however, FEMA will respond informally to discovery requests by parties. Specific assignment of professional responsibilities between NRC and FEMA counsel will be primarily the responsibility of the attorneys assigned to a particular case. In situations where questions of professional responsibility cannot be resolved by the attorneys assigned, resolution of any differences will be made by the General Counsel of FEMA and the General Counsel of the NRC or their designees. NRC will request the presiding Board to place FEMA on the service list for all litigation in which it is expected to participate.
</P>
<P>Nothing in this MOU shall be construed in any way to diminish NRC's responsibility for protecting the radiological health and safety of the public.
</P>
<HD3>B. FEMA Review of Offsite Plans and Preparedness
</HD3>
<P>NRC will assist in the development and review of offsite plans and preparedness through its membership on the Regional Assistance Committees (RAC). FEMA will chair the Regional Assistance Committees. Consistent with NRC's statutory responsibility, NRC will recognize FEMA as the interface with State and local governments for interpreting offsite radiological emergency planning and preparedness criteria as they affect those governments and for reporting to those governments the results of any evaluation of their radiological emergency plans and preparedness.
</P>
<P>Where questions arise concerning the interpretation of the criteria, such questions will continue to be referred to FEMA Headquarters, and when appropriate, to the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee to assure uniform interpretation.
</P>
<HD3>C. Preparation for and Evaluation of Joint Exercises
</HD3>
<P>FEMA and NRC will cooperate in determining exercise requirements for licensees, and State and local governments. They will also jointly observe and evaluate exercises. NRC and FEMA will institute procedures to enhance the review of objectives and scenarios for joint exercises. This review is to assure that both the onsite considerations of NRC and the offsite considerations of FEMA are adequately addressed and integrated in a manner that will provide for a technically sound exercise upon which an assessment of preparedness capabilities can be based. The NRC/FEMA procedures will provide for the availability of exercise objectives and scenarios sufficiently in advance of scheduled exercises to allow enough time for adequate review by NRC and FEMA and correction of any deficiencies by the licensee. The failure of a licensee to develop a scenario that adequately addresses both onsite and offsite considerations may result in NRC taking enforcement actions.
</P>
<P>The FEMA reports will be a part of an interim finding on emergency preparedness; or will be the result of an exercise conducted pursuant to FEMA's review and approval procedures under 44 CFR part 350 and NRC's requirement under 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, Section IV.F. Exercise evaluations will identify one of the following conditions: (1) There is reasonable assurance that the plans are adequate and can be implemented as demonstrated in the exercise; (2) there are deficiencies that must be corrected; or (3) FEMA is undecided and will provide a schedule of actions leading to a decision. The schedule for issuance of the draft and final exercise reports will be as shown in FEMA-REP-14 (Radiological Emergency Preparedness Exercise Manual).
</P>
<P>The deficiency referred to in (2) above is defined as an observed or identified inadequacy of organizational performance in an exercise that could cause a finding that offsite emergency preparedness is not adequate to provide reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken in the event of a radiological emergency to protect the health and safety of the public living in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant. Because of the potential impact of deficiencies on emergency preparedness, they should be corrected within 120 days through appropriate remedial actions, including remedial exercises, drills, or other actions.
</P>
<P>Where there are deficiencies of the types noted above, and when there is a potential for remedial actions, FEMA Headquarters will promptly (1-2 days) discuss these with NRC Headquarters. Within 10 days of the exercise, official notification of identified deficiencies will be made by FEMA to the State, NRC Headquarters, and the RAC with an information copy to the licensee. NRC will formally notify the licensee of the deficiencies and monitor the licensee's efforts to work with State and local authorities to correct the deficiencies. Approximately 60 days after official notification of the deficiency, the NRC, in consultation with FEMA, will assess the progress being made toward resolution of the deficiencies.
</P>
<HD3>D. Withdrawal of Reasonable Assurance Finding
</HD3>
<P>If FEMA determines under 44 CFR 350.13 of its regulations that offsite emergency plans or preparedness are not adequate to provide reasonable assurance that appropriate protective measures can be taken in the event of radiological emergency to protect the health and safety of the public, FEMA shall, as described in its rule, withdraw approval.
</P>
<P>Upon receiving notification of such action from FEMA, the NRC will promptly review FEMA's findings and determinations and formally document the NRC's position. When, as described in 10 CFR 50.54(s)(2)(ii) and 50.54(s)(3) of its regulations, the NRC finds the state of emergency preparedness does not provide reasonable assurance that adequate protective measures can and will be taken in the event of a radiological emergency, the NRC will notify the affected licensee accordingly and start the “120-day clock.” 
<SU>2</SU>
<FTREF/>
</P>
<FTNT>
<P>
<SU>2</SU> Per 10 CFR 50.54(s)(2)(ii), the Commission will determine whether the reactor shall be shut down or other appropriate enforcement actions if such conditions are not corrected within four months. The NRC is not limited by this provision of the rule, for, as stated in 10 CFR 50.54(s)(3), “Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as limiting the authority of the Commission to take action under any other regulation or authority of the Commission <I>or at any time other than that specified in this paragraph</I>” (emphasis added).</P></FTNT>
<HD3>E. Emergency Planning and Preparedness Guidance
</HD3>
<P>NRC has lead responsibility for the development of emergency planning and preparedness guidance for licensees. FEMA has lead responsibility for the development of radiological emergency planning and preparedness guidance for State and local agencies. NRC and FEMA recognize the need for an integrated, coordinated approach to radiological emergency planning and preparedness by NRC licensees and State and local governments. NRC and FEMA will each, therefore, provide opportunity for the other agency to review and comment on such guidance (including interpretations of agreed joint guidance) prior to adoption as formal agency guidance.
</P>
<HD3>F. Support for Document Management System
</HD3>
<P>FEMA and NRC will each provide the other with continued access to those automatic data processing support systems which contain relevant emergency preparedness data.
</P>
<HD3>G. Ongoing NRC Research and Development Programs
</HD3>
<P>Ongoing NRC and FEMA research and development programs that are related to State and local radiological emergency planning and preparedness will be coordinated. NRC and FEMA will each provide opportunity for the other agency to review and comment on relevant research and development programs prior to implementing them.
</P>
<HD3>H. Public Information and Education Programs
</HD3>
<P>FEMA will take the lead in developing public information and educational programs. NRC will assist FEMA by reviewing for accuracy educational materials concerning radiation, and its hazards and information regarding appropriate actions to be taken by the general public in the event of an accident involving radioactive materials.
</P>
<HD3>I. Recovery from Disasters Affecting Offsite Emergency Preparedness
</HD3>
<P>Disasters that destroy roads, buildings, communications, transportation resources or other offsite infrastructure in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant can degrade the capabilities of offsite response organizations in the 10-mile plume emergency planning zone. Examples of events that could cause such devastation are hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, major fires, large explosions, and riots.
</P>
<P>If a disaster damages the area around a licensed operating nuclear power plant to an extent that FEMA seriously questions the continued adequacy of offsite emergency preparedness, FEMA will inform the NRC promptly. Likewise, the NRC will inform FEMA promptly of any information it receives from licensees, its inspectors, or others, that raises serious questions about the continued adequacy of offsite emergency preparedness. If FEMA concludes that a disaster-initiated review of offsite radiological emergency preparedness is necessary to determine if offsite emergency preparedness is still adequate, it will inform the NRC in writing, as soon as practicable, including a schedule for conduct of the review. FEMA will also give the NRC (1) interim written reports of its findings, as appropriate, and (2) a final written report on the results of its review.
</P>
<P>The disaster-initiated review is performed to reaffirm the radiological emergency preparedness capabilities of affected offsite jurisdictions located in the 10-mile emergency planning zone and is not intended to be a comprehensive review of offsite plans and preparedness.
</P>
<P>The NRC will consider information provided by FEMA Headquarters and pertinent findings from FEMA's disaster-initiated review in making decisions regarding the restart or continued operation of an affected operating nuclear power reactor. The NRC will notify FEMA Headquarters, in writing, of the schedule for restart of an affected reactor and keep FEMA Headquarters informed of changes in that schedule.
</P>
<HD2>IV. NRC/FEMA Steering Committee
</HD2>
<P>The NRC/FEMA Steering Committee on Emergency Preparedness will continue to be the focal point for coordination of emergency planning and preparedness. As discussed in Section I of this agreement, response activities between these two agencies are addressed in a separate MOU. The Steering Committee will consist of an equal number of members to represent each agency with one vote per agency. When the Steering Committee cannot agree on the resolution of an issue, the issue will be referred to NRC and FEMA management. The NRC members will have lead responsibility for licensee planning and preparedness and the FEMA members will have lead responsibility for offsite planning and preparedness. The Steering Committee will assure coordination of plans and preparedness evaluation activities and revise, as necessary, acceptance criteria for licensee, State and local radiological emergency planning and preparedness. NRC and FEMA will then consider and adopt criteria, as appropriate, in their respective jurisdictions. (See Attachment 1).
</P>
<HD2>V. Working Arrangements
</HD2>
<P>A. The normal point of contact for implementation of the points in this MOU will be the NRC/FEMA Steering Committee.
</P>
<P>B. The Steering Committee will establish the day-to-day procedures for assuring that the arrangements of this MOU are carried out.
</P>
<HD2>VI. Memorandum of Understanding
</HD2>
<P>A. This MOU shall be effective as of date of signature and shall continue in effect unless terminated by either party upon 30 days notice in writing.
</P>
<P>B. Amendments or modifications to this MOU may be made upon written agreement by both parties.
</P>
<P>Approved for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

<HEAD>§ 354.1   Purpose.</HEAD>
<P>This part establishes the methodology for FEMA to assess and collect user fees from Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensees of commercial nuclear power plants to recover at least 100 percent of the amounts that we anticipate to obligate for our Radiological Emergency Preparedness (REP) Program as authorized under Title III, Public Law 105-276, 112 Stat. 2461, 2502. Public Law 105-276 established in the Treasury a Radiological Emergency Preparedness Fund, to be available under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2011 et. seq.), and under Executive Order 12657 (3 CFR, 1988 Comp., p. 611), for offsite radiological emergency planning, preparedness, and response. Beginning in fiscal year 1999 and thereafter, the Administrator of FEMA must publish fees to be assessed and collected, applicable to persons subject to FEMA's radiological emergency preparedness regulations. The methodology for assessment and collection of fees must be fair and equitable and must reflect the full amount of costs of providing radiological emergency planning, preparedness, response and associated services. Our assessment of fees include our costs for use of agency resources for classes of regulated persons and our administrative costs to collect the fees. Licensees deposit fees by electronic transfer into the Radiological Emergency Preparedness Fund in the U.S. Treasury as offsetting collections.

<DIV8 N="§ 354.4" NODE="44:1.0.1.6.88.0.10.4" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 354.4   Assessment of fees.</HEAD>
<P>(a)(1) We assess user fees from licensees using a methodology that includes charges for REP Program services provided by both our personnel and our contractors. Beginning in FY 1995, we established a four-year cycle from FY 1995-1998 with predetermined user fee assessments that were collected each year of the cycle. The following six-year cycle will run from FY 1999 through FY 2004. The fee for each site consists of two distinct components:
</P>
<P>(i) A <I>site-specific, biennial exercise-related component</I> to recover the portion of the REP program budget associated only with plume pathway emergency planning zone (EPZ) biennial exercise-related activities. We determine this component by reviewing average biennial exercise-related activities/hours that we use in exercises conducted since the inception of our REP user fee program in 1991. We completed an analysis of REP Program activities/hours used during the FY 1991-1995 cycle at the end of that four-year cycle. We will make adjustments to the site-specific user fees for the next proposed FY 1999-2004 six-year cycle.
</P>
<P>(ii) A <I>flat fee component</I> that is the same for each site and recovers the remaining portion of the REP Program budgeted funding that does not include biennial exercise-related activities.
</P>
<P>(2) We will assess fees only for REP Program services provided by our personnel and by our contractors, and we will not assess fees for those services that other Federal agencies involved in the FRPCC or the RAC's provide.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Determination of site-specific, biennial exercise-related component for our personnel.</I> We will determine an average biennial exercise-related cost for our personnel for each commercial nuclear power plant site in the REP Program. We base this annualized cost (dividing the average biennial exercise-related cost by two) on the average number of hours spent by our personnel in REP exercise-related activities for each site. We will determine the average number of hours using an analysis of site-specific exercise activity spent since the beginning of our user fee program (1991). We determine the actual user fee assessment for this component by multiplying the average number of REP exercise-related hours that we determine and annualize for each site by the average hourly rate in effect for the fiscal year for a REP Program employee. We will revise the hourly rate annually to reflect actual budget and cost of living factors, but the number of annualized, site-specific exercise hours will remain constant for user fee calculations and assessments throughout the six-year cycle. We will continue to track and monitor exercise activity during the six-year cycle, FY 1999-2004. We will make appropriate adjustments to this component to calculate user fee assessments for later six-year cycles.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Determination of site-specific, biennial exercise-related component for FEMA contract personnel.</I> We have determined an average biennial exercise-related cost for REP contractors for each commercial nuclear power plant site in the REP Program. We base this annualized cost (dividing the average biennial exercise-related cost by two) on the average costs of contract personnel in REP site-specific exercise-related activities since the beginning of our user fee program (1991). We will continue to track and monitor activity during the initial six-year cycle, FY 1999-2004, and we will make appropriate adjustments to this component for calculation of user fee assessments during subsequent six-year cycles.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Determination of flat fee component.</I> For each year of the six-year cycle, we recover the remainder of REP Program budgeted funds as a flat fee component. Specifically, we determine the flat fee component by subtracting the total of our personnel and contractor site-specific, biennial exercise-related components, as outlined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, from the total REP budget for that fiscal year. We then divide the resulting amount equally among the total number of licensed commercial nuclear power plant sites (defined under 354.2) to arrive at each site's flat fee component for that fiscal year.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Discontinuation of charges.</I> When we receive a copy from the NRC of their approved exemption to 10 CFR 50.54(q) requirements stating that offsite radiological emergency planning and preparedness are no longer required at a particular commercial nuclear power plant site, we will discontinue REP Program services at that site. We will no longer assess a user fee for that site from the beginning of the next fiscal year.

<HEAD>§ 360.1   Purpose.</HEAD>
<P>The Emergency Management Training Program is designed to enhance the States' emergency management training program to increase State capabilities and those of local governments in this field, as well as to give States the opportunity to develop new capabilities and techniques. The Program is an ongoing intergovernmental endeavor which combines financial and human resources to fill the unique training needs of local government, State emergency staffs and State agencies, as well as the general public. States will have the opportunity to develop, implement and evaluate various approaches to accomplish FEMA emergency objectives as well as goals and objectives of their own. The intended result is an enhanced capability to protect lives and property through planning, mitigation, operational skill, and rapid response in case of disaster or attack on this country.


</P>
</DIV8>


<DIV8 N="§ 360.2" NODE="44:1.0.1.6.90.0.10.2" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 360.2   Description of program.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The program is designed for all States regardless of their present level of involvement in training or their degree of expertise in originating and presenting training courses in the past. The needs of individual States, difference in numbers to be trained, and levels of sophistication in any previous training program have been recognized. It is thus believed that all States are best able to meet their own unique situations and those of local government by being given this opportunity and flexibility.
</P>
<P>(b) Each State is asked to submit an acceptable application, to be accompanied by a Training and Education (T&amp;E) plan for a total of three years, only the first year of which will be required to be detailed. The remaining two year program should be presented in terms of ongoing training objectives and programs. In the first year plan applicants shall delineate their objectives in training and education, including a description of the programs to be offered, and identify the audiences and numbers to be trained. Additionally, the State is asked to note the month in which the activity is to be presented, the location, and cost estimates including instructional costs and participant's travel and per diem. These specifics of date, place, and costs will be required for the first year of any three year plan. A three year plan will be submitted each year with an application. Each negotiated agreement will include a section of required training (Radiological Defense), and a section including optional courses to be conducted in response to State and local needs.
</P>
<P>(c) FEMA support to the States in their training program for State and local officials, has been designed around three Program elements. Each activity listed in the State Training and Education (T&amp;E) Plan will be derived from the following three elements:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Government Conducted Courses:</I> Such courses require the least capability on the part of the State. They are usually conducted through provisions in a FEMA Regional Support Contract and/or FEMA or other Federal agency staff. The State's responsibilities fall primarily into administrative areas of recruiting participants, making all arrangements for the facilities needed for presentation of the course, and the handling of the cost reimbursement to participants, though State staff may participate as instructors. These courses for example include:
</P>
<P>(i) Career Development Courses: Phases I, II, and III,
</P>
<P>(ii) Radiological Officer and Instructor Courses,
</P>
<P>(iii) Technical Workshops on Disaster Recovery or Hazard Mitigation.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Government and recipient conducted courses:</I> Responsibilities in these courses fall jointly upon Federal and State government as agreed in the planning for the course. Courses in this category might include:
</P>
<P>(i) Emergency Management Workshops,
</P>
<P>(ii) Multijurisdictional Emergency Operations Simulation Training.
</P>
<FP>In this category also, it is expected that the State will be responsible for administrative and logistical requirements, plus any instructional activity as agreed upon prior to the conduct of the course.
</FP>
<P>(3) <I>Recipient conducted courses:</I> This element requires the greatest degree of sophistication in program planning and delivery on the part of the State. Training events proposed by the State must be justified as addressing Emergency Management Training Program objectives. Additionally, they must address State or community needs and indicate the State's ability to present and carry out the Program of Instruction. Courses in this category could include:
</P>
<P>(i) Radiological Monitoring,
</P>
<P>(ii) Emergency Operations Simulating Training,
</P>
<P>(iii) Shelter Management.
</P>
<P>(d) In order that this three year comprehensive Training and Education Program planning can proceed in a timely and logical manner, each State will be provided three target appropriation figures, one for each of the three program years. States will develop their proposals, using the target figure to develop their scope of work. Adjustments in funding and the scope of work will be subject to negotiation before finalization. Both the funding and the scope of work will be reviewed each year and adjustments in the out years will reflect increased sophistication and expertise of the States as well as changing training needs within each State.
</P>
<P>(e)(1) FEMA funding through the State Cooperative Agreement for the training activities is to be used for travel and per diem expenses of students selected by the States for courses reflecting individually needed or required training. Additionally funds may be expended for course materials and instructor expenses. The funding provided in the State Cooperative Agreement is not for the purpose of conducting ongoing State activities or for funding staff positions to accomplish work to be performed under this Agreement. Nor is the Agreement for the purpose of purchasing equipment which may be obtained with the help of Personnel and Administrative funds. In cases where equipment has been identified as needed in the scope of work submitted with the application, and where it serves as an outreach to a new audience or methodology, equipment purchase may be approved at the time of initial application approval.
</P>
<P>(2) Allowable cost will be funded at 100%.

<HEAD>§ 361.2   Definitions.</HEAD>
<P><I>Cash Contribution</I> means the State cash outlay (expenditure), including the outlay of money contributed to the State by other public agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. All expenditures must be listed in the project's approved budget.
</P>
<P><I>Certification</I> represents the Governor's written assurance describing the steps State agencies will take toward meeting the 50 percent cash contribution required following the third year of program funding. The letter of certification is intended to assist the State maintain a commitment to and plan for securing the future cash match with the long-range goal of developing an ongoing, rather than a short-term, State program.
</P>
<P><I>Cost Sharing</I> and <I>Matching</I> represent that portion of project costs not borne by the Federal Government.
</P>
<P><I>Eligible Activities</I> are activities for which FEMA may provide funding to States under this section. They include specific activities or projects related to earthquake hazards reduction which fall into one or more of the following categories: Preparedness and response planning; mitigation planning and implementation, including inventories preparation, seismic safety inspections of critical structures and lifelines, updating building and zoning codes and ordinances to enhance seismic safety; and public awareness and education. The activities that will actually be funded shall be determined through individual negotiations between FEMA and the States (see criteria in § 361.3(3)).
</P>
<P><I>In-kind contributions</I> represent the value of non-cash contributions provided by the States and other non-Federal parties. In-kind contributions may be in the form of charges for real property and non-expendable personal property and the value of goods and services directly benefiting and specifically identifiable to the States' earthquake hazards reduction projects.
</P>
<P><I>Project</I> means the complete set of approved earthquake hazards reduction activities undertaken by a State, or other jurisdiction, on a cost-shared basis with FEMA in a given Federal fiscal year.
</P>
<P><I>Project Period</I> is the duration of time over which an earthquake hazards reduction project is implemented.
</P>
<P><I>State</I> refers to the States of the United States of America, individually or collectively, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Mariana Islands, and any other territory or possession of the United States. It also means local units of government or substate areas that include a number of local government jurisdictions.
</P>
<P><I>State Assistance</I> means the funding provided under this subpart by FEMA through the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) to States to develop State programs specifically related to earthquake hazards reduction. The term also includes assistance to local units of government or substate areas, such as a group of several counties.
</P>
<P><I>Target Allocation</I> is the maximum amount of FEMA earthquake program funds presumably available to an eligible State in a fiscal year. It is based primarily upon the total amount of State assistance funds available to FEMA annually, the number of eligible States, and a nationally standardized comparison of these States' seismic hazard and population-at-risk. The target allocation is not necessarily the amount of funding that a State will actually receive from FEMA. Rather, it represents a planning basis of negotiations between the State and its FEMA Regional Office which will ultimately determine the actual amount of earthquake State assistance to be provided by FEMA.

<DIV8 N="§ 361.3" NODE="44:1.0.1.6.91.1.10.3" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 361.3   Project description.</HEAD>
<P>(a) An objective of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act is to develop, in areas of seismic risk, improved understanding of and capability with respect to earthquake-related issues, including methods of mitigating earthquake damage, planning to prevent or minimize earthquake damage, disseminating warnings of earthquakes, organizing emergency services, and planning for post-earthquake recovery. To achieve this objective, FEMA has implemented an earthquake hazards reduction assistance program for State and local governments in seismic risk areas.
</P>
<P>(b) This assistance program provides funding for earthquake hazards reduction activities which are eligible according to the definition in § 361.2. The categories, or program elements, listed therein comprise a comprehensive earthquake hazards reduction project for any given seismic hazard area. Key aspects of each of these elements are as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Mitigation</I> involves developing and implementing strategies for reducing losses from earthquakes by incorporating principles of seismic safety into public and private decisions regarding the siting, design, and construction of structures (i.e., updating building and zoning codes and ordinances to enhance seismic safety), and regarding buildings' nonstructural elements, contents and furnishings. Mitigation includes preparing inventories of and conducting seismic safety inspections of critical structures and lifelines, and developing plans for identifying and retrofitting existing structures that pose threats to life or would suffer major damage in the event of a serious earthquake.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Preparedness/response planning</I> are closely related and usually considered as one comprehensive activity. They do differ, however, in that preparedness planning involves those efforts undertaken before an earthquake to prepare for or improve capability to respond to the event, while response planning can be defined as the planning necessary to implement an effective response once the earthquake has occurred. Preparedness/response planning usually considers functions related to the following:
</P>
<P>(i) Rescue and fire services;
</P>
<P>(ii) Medical services;
</P>
<P>(iii) Damage assessments;
</P>
<P>(iv) Communications;
</P>
<P>(v) Security;
</P>
<P>(vi) Restoration of lifeline and utility services;
</P>
<P>(vii) Transportation;
</P>
<P>(viii) Sheltering, food and water supplies;
</P>
<P>(ix) Public health and information services;
</P>
<P>(x) Post-disaster recovery and the return of economic stability;
</P>
<P>(xi) Secondary impacts, such as dam failures, toxic releases, etc.; and
</P>
<P>(xii) Organization and management.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Public awareness/earthquake education</I> activities are designed to increase public awareness of earthquakes and their associated risks, and to stimulate behavioral changes to foster a self-help approach to earthquake preparedness, response, and mitigation. Audiences that may be targeted for such efforts include:
</P>
<P>(i) The general public;
</P>
<P>(ii) School populations (administrators, teachers, students, and parents);
</P>
<P>(iii) Special needs groups (e.g., elderly, disabled, non-English speaking);
</P>
<P>(iv) Business and industry;
</P>
<P>(v) Engineers, architects, builders;
</P>
<P>(vi) The media; and
</P>
<P>(vii) Public officials.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Other Activities</I> in support of those listed in § 361.3(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) may include, but are not limited to, State seismic advisory boards which provide State and local officials responsible for implementing earthquake hazards reduction projects with expert advice in a variety of fields; hazard identification which defines the potential for earthquakes and their related geological hazards in a particular area; and vulnerability assessments, also known as loss estimation studies, which provide information on the impacts and consequences of an earthquake on an area's resources, as well as opportunities for earthquake hazards mitigation.
</P>
<P>(c) State eligibility for financial assistance to States under this section is determined by FEMA based on a combination of the following criteria:
</P>
<P>(1) Seismic hazard, including the historic occurrence of damaging earthquakes, as well as probable seismic activity;
</P>
<P>(2) Total population and major urban concentrations exposed to such risk; and
</P>
<P>(3) Other factors, the loss, damage, or disruption of which by a severe earthquake would have serious national impacts upon national security, such as industrial concentrations, concentrations or occurrences of natural resources, financial/economic centers and national defense facilities.
</P>
<P>(d) Each fiscal year, FEMA will establish a target allocation of earthquake program funds for each eligible State.
</P>
<P>(e) The specific activities, and the distribution of funds among them, that will be undertaken with this assistance will be determined during the annual Comprehensive Cooperative Agreement (CCA) negotiations between FEMA and the State, and will be based upon the following:
</P>
<P>(1) The availability of information regarding identification of seismic hazards and vulnerability to those hazards;
</P>
<P>(2) Earthquake hazards reduction accomplishments of the State to date;
</P>
<P>(3) State and Federal priorities for needed earthquake hazards reduction activities; and
</P>
<P>(4) State and local capabilities with respect to staffing, professional expertise, and funding.
</P>
<P>(f) As a condition of receiving FEMA funding, a percentage of the amount of the total State project (FEMA State assistance, combined with the State match) must be spent for activities under the Mitigation Planning element. The percentage, to be determined by FEMA, may be increased by no more than 5 percent annually, beginning at 15 percent in fiscal year 1991 with a limit of 50 percent of the total State project. The increase will take into account the amount of time a State has been participating in the program. States may expend more than the required percentage of funding on eligible mitigation activities.
</P>
<P>(g) The State match may be distributed among the eligible activities in any manner that is mutually agreed upon by FEMA and the State in the CCA negotiations.
</P>
<P>(h) Negotiations between FEMA and the State regarding the scope of work and the determination of the amount of State assistance to be awarded shall consider earthquake hazards reduction activities previously accomplished by the State, as well as the quality of their performance.

<DIV8 N="§ 361.4" NODE="44:1.0.1.6.91.1.10.4" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 361.4   Matching contributions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) All State assistance will be cost shared after the first year of funding. States which received a grant before October 1, 1990, which included the 50 percent non-Federal contribution to the State program, will continue to match the Federal funds on a 50 percent cash match basis.
</P>
<P>(b) States which did not receive a grant before October 1, 1990, will assume cost sharing on a phased-in basis over a period of four years with the full cost sharing requirements being implemented in the fourth year. The sequence is as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) For the first fiscal year, cost sharing will be voluntary. FEMA will provide State assistance without requiring a State match. Those States that are able to cost-share are encouraged to do so (on either a cash or in-kind basis).
</P>
<P>(2) For the second fiscal year, the minimum acceptable non-Federal contribution is 25 percent of the total project cost, which may be satisfied through an in-kind contribution. Those States that are able to cost-share on a cash-contribution basis are encouraged to do so.
</P>
<P>(3) For the third fiscal year, the minimum acceptable non-Federal contribution is 35 percent of the total project cost, which may be satisfied through an in-kind contribution. Those States that are able to cost-share on a cash-contribution basis are encouraged to do so.
</P>
<P>(4) For the fourth and subsequent fiscal years, full cost sharing will be implemented, requiring a minimum of a 50 percent non-Federal contribution to a State program, with this share required to be cash. In-kind matching will no longer be acceptable. Thus, every dollar FEMA provides to a State must be matched by one dollar from the State. States that can contribute an amount greater than that required by the match are permitted and encouraged to do so. However, State assistance will not exceed the established target allocation.
</P>
<P>(c) The State contribution need not be applied at the exact time of the obligation of the Federal funds. However, the State full matching share must be obligated by the end of the project period for which the State assistance has been made available for obligation under an approved program or budget.
</P>
<P>(d) In the event a State interrupts its participation in this program, if it later elects to participate again, the nature and amount of that State's cost sharing shall be determined by the regulations then in effect, taking into account the number of years in which the State previously participated.


</P>

<HEAD>§ 361.5   Criteria for program assistance, matching contributions, and return of program assistance funds.</HEAD>
<P>(a) In order to qualify for assistance, a State must:
</P>
<P>(1) Demonstrate that the assistance will result in enhanced seismic safety in the State;
</P>
<P>(2) Provide a share of the costs of the activities for which assistance is being given, in accordance with § 361.4; and
</P>
<P>(3) Demonstrate that it is taking actions to ensure its ability to meet the 50 percent cash contribution commitment either on an ongoing basis or for new States, by the fourth year of funding.
</P>
<P>(i) The Governor of newly participating State must certify to the FEMA Regional Administrator the State will take steps to meet the 50 percent cash contribution requirement after the third year of funding. The specific steps to be taken will be outlined in the certification which must be submitted prior to the State receiving program funds.
</P>
<P>(ii) The Governor must certify the State's continued commitment in the second and third years of funding. The certification will describe the progress made on the steps contained in the previous year's certification and steps to be taken in the future. The certification must be submitted to the Regional Administrator before the State will receive program funds.
</P>
<P>(iii) If a State encounters difficulties meeting the 50 percent cash contribution requirement for the target allocation following the fourth year of funding, the Regional Administrator may require the Governor to continue certifying the State is working to resolve the difficulty.
</P>
<P>(iv) A State will not receive Federal funds if it cannot provide the required cash contribution.
</P>
<P>(b) The value of any resources accepted as a matching share under one Federal agreement or program cannot be counted again as a contribution under another.
</P>
<P>(c) The State seeking the match shall submit documentation sufficient for FEMA to determine that the contribution meets the following requirements. The match shall be:
</P>
<P>(1) Necessary and reasonable for proper, cost-effective and efficient administration of the project, allocable solely thereto, and except as specifically provided herein, not be a general expense required to carry out the overall responsibilities of State and local governments;
</P>
<P>(2) Verifiable from the recipient State's records;
</P>
<P>(3) Not allocable to or included as a cost of any other Federally financed program in either the current or a prior period;
</P>
<P>(4) Authorized under State law;
</P>
<P>(5) Consistent with any limitations or exclusions set forth in these regulations, Federal laws or other governing limitations as to types of cost items;
</P>
<P>(6) Accorded consistent treatment through application of generally accepted accounting principles appropriate to the circumstances;
</P>
<P>(7) Provided for in the approved budget/workplan of the State; and
</P>
<P>(8) Consistent with 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002.
</P>
<P>(d) A State must submit and FEMA must approve a statement of work before the State receives any grant funds. The statement of work and target allocation of funds are based on a 12-month performance period. Except under extenuating circumstances, the funds initially obligated to the State will be based on the amount of time remaining in the performance period at the time the statement of work is approved.
</P>
<P>(e) States are expected to perform activities and therefore expend funds on a quarterly basis in accordance with the approved statement of work. At the end of the third quarter, State and FEMA regional office staff will review the State's accomplishments to date. Funds not expended in accordance with the approved statement of work by the end of the third quarter of the performance period will not be made available to the State unless the State can demonstrate, and FEMA approves, its ability to perform activities adequately resulting in the expenditure of the funds by the end of the performance period.

<HEAD>§ 402.2   Restricted commodities.</HEAD>
<P>The restrictions of Transportation Order T-1 apply to the transportation or discharge of (a) commodities on the Positive List (15 CFR part 399) (as amended from time to time) of the Comprehensive Export Schedule of the Office of International Trade, Department of Commerce, (b) articles on the list of arms, ammunition and implements of war coming within the meaning of Proclamation No. 2776 of March 26, 1948, and (c) commodities, including fissionable materials, controlled for export under the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. The restrictions imposed by Transportation Order T-1 do not apply to other commodities, not within these restricted classes at the time of transportation or discharge, even though authorization for the export of the commodity from the United States to the particular destination is required under regulations of the Office of International Trade or under other Federal law or regulation. In this respect, Order T-1 is different from Order T-2 which applies to all commodities destined to Communist China. Order T-1 does not relax or modify any of the requirements of any other regulation or law.

<DIV8 N="§ 402.3" NODE="44:1.0.2.7.3.0.10.3" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 402.3   Addition of commodities to the Positive List.</HEAD>
<P>Order T-1 applies to the transportation or discharge of commodities which are restricted at the time of transportation or discharge. Accordingly, if a commodity is added to the Positive List while the commodity is being transported on an American flag ship or aircraft, the restrictions of Order T-1 immediately apply and the commodity may not be transported to or discharged at any of the restricted ports or discharged in transit to one of the restricted ports, unless authorization under Order T-1 is obtained.

<HEAD>§ 402.4   Calls at restricted ports en route to an unrestricted port with restricted cargo.</HEAD>
<P>Order T-1 does not prohibit an American flag ship or aircraft from going to or calling at one of the restricted ports, even though it has on board a commodity which could not be discharged at that port. (Note, however, that Order T-2 prohibits American flag ships and aircraft from calling at any port or other place in Communist China.) For example, an American flag ship may call at one of the restricted ports (except one in Communist China), even though it has on board the following classes of commodities:
</P>
<P>(a) A Positive List commodity manifested to a destination outside the restricted area, with an export license and an export declaration showing the unrestricted destination at the ultimate destination, (b) a Positive List commodity destined for the restricted port of call which cannot be discharged there because there is no export license or authorization from the Assistant Secretary for Domestic and International Business permitting discharge at the restricted port of call, (c) a commodity of any kind destined for Communist China (the transportation and discharge of which is covered by Order T-2). None of these commodities may be discharged at the restricted port of call. Discharge of any of these commodities at the port covered by the restrictions of Order T-1 is prohibited and subject to penalty, regardless of the circumstances under which the discharge of the cargo at the restricted port occurs, unless appropriate authorization is obtained.

<DIV8 N="§ 402.5" NODE="44:1.0.2.7.3.0.10.5" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 402.5   Forwarding commodities previously shipped.</HEAD>
<P>Order T-1 applies to transportation on or discharge from ships documented under the laws of the United States and aircraft registered under the laws of the United States. These restrictions apply either in the case of a discharge at one of the restricted ports or to discharge at any other port in transit to a restricted destination. The restrictions of Order T-1 do not apply to transportation by foreign carriers, as long as there is no prohibited transportation or discharge by or from a United States flag ship or aircraft after the issuance of Order T-1. Accordingly, if an American flag ship or aircraft, before the issuance of Order T-1, had transported restricted commodities manifested to restricted destinations, and had completed the transportation to a foreign intermediate point and had completed the discharge from the American flag ship or aircraft before the issuance of Order T-1, no violation of that order would have occurred, but Order T-1 would prohibit further shipment on an American flag ship or aircraft unless authorization under Order T-1 is obtained.

<DIV8 N="§ 402.6" NODE="44:1.0.2.7.3.0.10.6" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 402.6   Relation to Transportation Order T-2.</HEAD>
<P>Transportation Order T-1 applies to the transportation of commodities to, or in transit to, destinations in Sub-Group A, Hong Kong or Macao. It applies, however, only to commodities on the Positive List of the Office of International Trade, arms and ammunition, and commodities controlled under the Atomic Energy Act (see section 2 of this interpretation). Transportation Order T-2 applies to the transportation of commodities of any kind which are destined to Communist China (Order T-2 also prohibits American ships and aircraft from calling at any port or place in Communist China). Since Communist China is in Sub-Group A, the restrictions of both orders apply to the transportation of commodities to Communist China or to any other point in transit to Communist China.
