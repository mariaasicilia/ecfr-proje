<HEAD>§ 1.1   Establishment of the U.S. Postal Service.</HEAD>
<P>The U.S. Postal Service is established under the provisions of the Postal Reorganization Act (the Reorganization Act) of 1970, Public Law 91-375, 84 Stat. 719, as amended by the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (PAEA), Public Law 109-435, 120 Stat. 3198, as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States, under the direction of a Board of Governors, with the Postmaster General as its chief executive officer. The Board of Governors of the Postal Service (the Board) directs the exercise of its powers through management that is expected to be honest, efficient, economical, and mindful of the competitive business environment in which the Postal Service operates. The Board consists of nine Governors appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to represent the public interest generally, together with the Postmaster General and Deputy Postmaster General.

<P>Except for powers, duties, or obligations specifically vested in the Governors by law, the Board may delegate its authority to the Postmaster General under such terms, conditions, and limitations, including the power of redelegation, as it finds desirable. The bylaws of the Board are the framework of the system through which the Board monitors the exercise of the authority it has delegated, measures progress toward the goals it has set, and shapes the policies to guide the future development of the Postal Service. Delegations of authority do not relieve the Board of full responsibility for carrying out its duties and functions, and are revocable by the Governors in their exclusive judgment.

<HEAD>§ 10.4   Financial disclosure reports.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Requirement of submission of reports</I>—(1) <I>Upon nomination.</I> At the time of their nomination, Governors complete a financial disclosure report which, under the practice of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is kept confidential.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>After confirmation.</I> Because the Director of the Office of Government Ethics has concluded that Governors who do not perform the duties of their office for more than 60 days in any calendar year are not required to file financial disclosure reports that are open to the public, Governors file non-public reports annually, in accordance with this section. A Governor who performs the duties of his or her office for more than 60 days in a particular calendar year is required to file a public report in accordance with 5 CFR 2634.204(c).
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Person with whom reports should be filed and time for filing.</I> (1) A Governor shall file a financial disclosure report with the Associate General Counsel on or before May 15 of each year when the Governor has been in office for more than 60 consecutive calendar days during the previous year.
</P>
<P>(2) The Associate General Counsel may, for good cause shown, grant to a Governor one or more extensions totaling not more than 90 days.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Information required to be reported.</I> Each report shall be a full and complete statement, on the form prescribed by the Associate General Counsel and the Office of Government Ethics and in accordance with instructions issued by him or her.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Reviewing reports.</I> (1) Financial disclosure reports filed in accordance with the provisions of this section shall, within 60 days after the date of filing, be reviewed by the Associate General Counsel who shall either approve the report, or make an initial determination that a conflict or appearance thereof exists. If the Associate General Counsel determines initially that a conflict or the appearance of a conflict exists, he or she shall inform the Governor of his or her determination.
</P>
<P>(2) If the Associate General Counsel considers that additional information is needed to complete the report or to allow an adequate review to be conducted, he or she shall request the reporting Governor to furnish that information by a specified date.
</P>
<P>(3) The Associate General Counsel shall refer to the Chairman of the Board of Governors or the Vice Chairman the name of any Governor he or she has reasonable cause to believe has wrongfully failed to file a report or has falsified or wrongfully failed to report required information.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Custody of and public access to reports</I>—(1) <I>Retention of reports.</I> Each report filed with the Associate General Counsel shall be retained by him or her for a period of six years. After the six-year period, the report shall be destroyed unless needed in connection with an investigation then pending.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Confidentiality of reports.</I> Unless a public report is required by this section, the financial disclosure reports filed by Governors shall not be made public.

A claim is not considered filed if it is received by any other office or official. In addition, a claim in an administrative forfeiture proceeding is not considered filed if received only by an electronic or facsimile transmission.
</P>
<P>(ii) For purposes of computing the start of the 90-day period set forth in 18 U.S.C. 983(a)(3), an administrative forfeiture claim is filed on the date when the claim is received by the designated official, even if the claim is received from an incarcerated <I>pro se</I> prisoner.

</P>
<P>(2) <I>Turnover of assets seized by state and local agencies.</I> (i) Property that is seized by a state or local law enforcement agency and transferred to the Postal Inspection Service for administrative or civil forfeiture may be adopted for administrative forfeiture without the issuance of any Federal seizure warrant or other Federal judicial process.
</P>
<P>(ii) Where a state or local law enforcement agency maintains custody of property pursuant to process issued by a state or local judicial authority, and notifies the Postal Inspection Service of the impending release of such property, the Postal Inspection Service may seek and obtain a Federal seizure warrant in anticipation of a state or local judicial authority releasing the asset from state process for purposes of Federal seizure, and may execute such seizure warrant when the state or local law enforcement agency releases the property as allowed or directed by its judicial authority.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Inventory.</I> The Postal Inspection Service shall prepare an inventory of any seized property.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Custody.</I> (1) All property seized by Postal Inspectors for forfeiture shall be delivered to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, or custodian approved by the U.S. Marshals Service, as soon as possible after seizure, unless it is retained as evidence.
</P>
<P>(2) Seized U.S. currency (and to the extent practicable seized foreign currency and negotiable instruments) must be deposited promptly in the Holding Account—Seizure and Forfeiture under the control of the Postal Inspection Service pending forfeiture. Provisional exceptions to this requirement may be granted as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) If the seized currency has a value less than $5,000, and a supervisory official within the U.S. Attorney's Office determines in writing that the currency is reasonably likely to serve a significant, independent, tangible, evidentiary purpose, or that retention is necessary while the potential evidentiary significance of the currency is being determined by scientific testing or otherwise, or
</P>
<P>(ii) The seized currency has a value greater than $5,000, and the Chief, Asset Forfeiture Money Laundering Section (AFMLS) determines in writing that the currency is reasonably likely to serve a significant, independent, tangible, evidentiary purpose, or that retention is necessary while the potential evidentiary significance of the currency is being determined by scientific testing or otherwise.
</P>
<P>(3) Seized currency has a <I>significant independent, evidentiary purpose</I> as those terms are used in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (f)(2)(ii) of this section if, for example, it bears fingerprint evidence, is packaged in an incriminating fashion, or contains a traceable amount of narcotic residue or some other substance of evidentiary significance. If only a portion of the seized currency has evidentiary value, only that portion should be retained; the balance should be deposited.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Appraisal.</I> The Postal Inspection Service shall determine the domestic value of the seized property as soon as practicable following seizure.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Release before claim.</I> (1) After seizure for forfeiture and prior to the filing of any claim, the appropriate official is authorized to release property seized for forfeiture provided:
</P>
<P>(i) The property is not contraband, evidence of a violation of law, or any property, the possession of which by the claimant, petitioner, or the person from whom it was seized is prohibited by state or Federal law, and does not have a design or other characteristic that particularly suits it for use in illegal activities; and
</P>
<P>(ii) The appropriate official determines within 10 days of seizure that there is an innocent party with the right to immediate possession of the property or that the release would be in the best interest of justice or the Government.
</P>
<P>(2) Further, at any time after seizure and before any claim is filed, such seized property may be released if the appropriate official determines that there is an innocent party with the right to immediate possession of the property or that the release would be in the best interest of justice or the Government.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Commencing an administrative forfeiture.</I> An administrative forfeiture proceeding begins when notice is first published in accordance with paragraph 233.7(i)(1), or the first personal written notice is sent in accordance with paragraph 233.7(i)(2), whichever occurs first.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Notice of administrative forfeiture</I>—(1) <I>Notice by publication.</I> (i) After seizing property subject to administrative forfeiture, the Appropriate Official shall select from the following options a means of publication reasonably calculated to notify potential claimants of the seizure and intent to forfeit and sell or otherwise dispose of the property:

</P>

<P>(D) State the identity of the appropriate official of the Postal Inspection Service and address where the claim must be filed.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Personal written notice</I>—(i) <I>Manner of providing notice.</I> After seizing property subject to administrative forfeiture, the Postal Inspection Service, in addition to publishing notice, shall send personal written notice of the seizure to each interested party in a manner reasonably calculated to reach such parties.

</P>
<P>(D) State the identity of the appropriate official of the Postal Inspection Service and the address where the claim must be filed; and
</P>
<P>(E) Describe the seized property.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Timing of notice</I>—(i) <I>Date of personal notice.</I> Personal written notice is sent on the date when the Postal Inspection Service causes it to be placed in the mail, or otherwise sent by means reasonably calculated to reach the interested party. The personal written notice required by paragraph (i)(2) of this section shall be sent as soon as practicable, and in no case more than 60 days after the date of seizure (or 90 days after the date of seizure by a state or local law enforcement agency if the property was turned over to the Postal Inspection Service for the purpose of forfeiture under Federal law).
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Civil judicial forfeiture.</I> If, before the time period for sending notice expires, the Government files a civil judicial forfeiture action against the seized property and provides notice of such action as required by law, personal notice of administrative forfeiture is not required under this paragraph.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Criminal indictment.</I> If, before the time period for sending notice under this paragraph expires, no civil judicial forfeiture action is filed, but a criminal indictment or information is obtained containing an allegation that the property is subject to forfeiture, the seizing agency shall either:
</P>
<P>(A) Send timely personal written notice and continue the administrative forfeiture proceeding; or
</P>
<P>(B) After consulting with the U.S. Attorney, terminate the administrative forfeiture proceeding and notify the custodian to return the property to the person having the right to immediate possession unless the U.S. Attorney takes steps necessary to maintain custody of the property as provided in the applicable criminal forfeiture statute.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Subsequent Federal seizure.</I> If property is seized by a state or local law enforcement agency, but personal written notice is not sent to the person from whom the property is seized within the time period for providing notice under paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section, then any administrative forfeiture proceeding against the property may commence if:
</P>
<P>(i) The property is subsequently seized or restrained by the Postal Inspection Service pursuant to a Federal seizure warrant or restraining order and the Postal Inspection Service sends notice as soon as practicable, and in no case more than 60 days after the date of the Federal seizure; or
</P>
<P>(ii) The owner of the property consents to forfeiture of the property.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Tolling.</I> (i) In states or localities where orders are obtained from a state court authorizing the turnover of seized assets to the Postal Inspection Service, the period from the date an application or motion is presented to the state court for the turnover order through the date when such order is issued by the court shall not be included in the time period for providing notice under paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) If property is detained at an international border or port of entry for the purpose of examination, testing, inspection, obtaining documentation, or other investigation relating to the importation of the property into, or the exportation of the property from the United States, such period of detention shall not be included in the period described in paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this section. In such cases, the 60-day period shall begin to run when the period of detention ends, if a seizing agency seizes the property for the purpose of forfeiture to the United States.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Identity of interested party.</I> If the Postal Inspection Service determines the identity or interest of an interested party after the seizure or adoption of the property, but before entering a declaration of forfeiture, the Postal Inspection Service shall send written notice to such interested party under paragraph 3(i) not later than 60 days after determining the identity of the interested party or the interested party's interest.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Extending deadline for notice.</I> The Chief Counsel for the Postal Inspection Service may extend the period for sending personal written notice under these regulations in a particular case for a period not to exceed 30 days (which period may not be further extended except by a court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 983(a)(1)(C), (D)), if the Chief Counsel for the Postal Inspection Service determines, and states in writing, that there is reason to believe that notice may have an adverse result, including: Endangering the life or physical safety of an individual; flight from prosecution; destruction of or tampering with evidence; intimidation of potential witnesses; or otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation, or unduly delaying a trial.
</P>
<P>(8) <I>Certification.</I> The Chief Counsel for the Postal Inspection Service shall provide the written certification required under 18 U.S.C. 983(a)(1)(C) when the Government requests it and the conditions described in 18 U.S.C. 983(a)(1)(D) are present.
</P>
<P>(k) <I>Claims</I>—(1) <I>Filing.</I> In order to contest the forfeiture of seized property in Federal court, any person asserting an interest in seized property subject to an administrative forfeiture proceeding under these regulations must file a claim with the appropriate official, after the commencement of the administrative forfeiture proceeding as defined in paragraph (h) of this section, and not later than the deadline set forth in a personal notice letter sent pursuant to paragraph (i)(2) of this section. If personal written notice is sent but not received, then the intended recipient must file a claim with the appropriate official not later than 30 days after the date of the final publication of the notice of seizure.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Contents of claim.</I> A claim shall:
</P>
<P>(i) Identify the specific property being claimed;
</P>
<P>(ii) Identify the claimant and state the claimant's interest in the property; and
</P>
<P>(iii) Be made under oath by the claimant, not counsel for the claimant, and recite that it is made under the penalty of perjury, consistent with the requirements of 28 U.S.C. 1746. An acknowledgement, attestation, or certification by a notary public alone is insufficient.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Availability of claim forms.</I> The claim need not be made in any particular form. However, the Postal Inspection Service will make claim forms generally available on request. Such forms shall be written in easily understandable language. A request for a claim form does not extend the deadline for filing a claim. Any person may obtain a claim form by requesting one in writing from the appropriate official.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Cost bond not required.</I> Any person may file a claim under paragraph 233.7(k)(1) without posting bond, except in forfeitures under statutes listed in 18 U.S.C. 983(i).
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Referral of claim.</I> Upon receipt of a claim that meets the requirements of paragraphs (k)(1) and (2) of this section, the Postal Inspection Service shall return the property or suspend the administrative forfeiture proceeding and promptly transmit the claim, together with a description of the property and a complete statement of the facts and circumstances surrounding the seizure, to the appropriate U.S. Attorney for commencement of judicial forfeiture proceedings. Upon making the determination that the seized property will be released, the Postal Inspection Service shall promptly notify the person with a right to immediate possession of the property, informing that person to contact the property custodian within a specified period for release of the property, and further informing that person that failure to contact the property custodian within the specified period for release of the property will result in abandonment of the property pursuant to applicable regulations. The Postal Inspection Service shall notify the property custodian of the identity of the person to whom the property should be released. The property custodian shall have the right to require presentation of proper identification and/or to take other steps to verify the identity of the person who seeks the release of property, or both.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Premature filing.</I> If a claim is filed with the appropriate official after the seizure of the property, but before the commencement of the administrative forfeiture proceeding as defined in paragraph (i) of this section, the claim shall be deemed filed on the 30th day after the commencement of the administrative forfeiture proceeding. If such claim meets the requirements of paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the Postal Inspection Service shall suspend the administrative forfeiture proceedings and promptly transmit the claim, together with a description of the property and a complete statement of the facts and circumstances surrounding the seizure to the appropriate U.S. Attorney for commencement of judicial forfeiture proceedings.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Defective claims.</I> If the Postal Inspection Service determines that an otherwise timely claim does not meet the requirements of paragraph (k)(2) of this section, the Postal Inspection Service may notify the claimant of this determination and allow the claimant a reasonable time to cure the defect(s) in the claim. If, within the time allowed by the Postal Inspection Service, the requirements of paragraph (k)(2) of this section are not met, the claim shall be void and the forfeiture proceedings shall proceed as if no claim had been submitted. If the claimant timely cures the deficiency, then the claim shall be deemed filed on the date when the appropriate official receives the cured claim.
</P>
<P>(l) <I>Interplay of administrative and criminal judicial forfeiture proceedings.</I> An administrative forfeiture proceeding pending against seized or restrained property does not bar the Government from alleging that the same property is forfeitable in a criminal case. Notwithstanding the fact that an allegation of forfeiture has been included in a criminal indictment or information, the property may be administratively forfeited in a parallel proceeding.
</P>
<P>(m) <I>Requests for hardship release of seized property.</I> (1) Under certain circumstances, a claimant may be entitled to immediate release of seized property on the basis of hardship.
</P>
<P>(2) Any person filing a request for hardship release must also file a claim to the seized property pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section and as defined in 18 U.S.C. 983(a).
</P>
<P>(3) The timely filing of a valid claim pursuant to paragraph (k) of this section does not entitle the claimant to possession of the seized property, but a claimant may request immediate release of the property while forfeiture is pending, based on hardship.
</P>
<P>(4) A claimant seeking release of property under 18 U.S.C. 983(f) and these regulations must file a written request with the appropriate official. The request must establish that:
</P>
<P>(i) The claimant has a possessory interest in the property;
</P>
<P>(ii) The claimant has sufficient ties to the community to provide assurance that the property will be available at the time of trial;
</P>
<P>(iii) The continued possession by the Government pending the final disposition of forfeiture proceedings will cause substantial hardship to the claimant, such as preventing the functioning of a business, preventing an individual from working, or leaving an individual homeless;
</P>
<P>(iv) The claimant's likely hardship from the continued possession by the Government of the seized property outweighs the risk that the property will be destroyed, damaged, lost, concealed, or transferred if it is returned to the claimant during the pendency of the proceeding; and
</P>
<P>(v) The property is not:
</P>
<P>(A) Contraband, any property, the possession of which by the claimant, petitioner, or person from whom it was seized is prohibited by state or Federal law, currency, or other monetary instrument, or electronic funds unless such currency or other monetary instrument or electronic funds constitutes the assets of a legitimate business which has been seized;
</P>
<P>(B) Intended to be used as evidence of a violation of law;
</P>
<P>(C) By reason of design or other characteristic, particularly suited for use in illegal activities; or
</P>
<P>(D) Likely to be used to commit additional criminal acts if returned to the claimant.
</P>
<P>(5) A hardship release request pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed to have been made on the date when it is received by the appropriate official as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, or the date the claim was deemed filed under paragraph (k) of this section. If the request is ruled on and denied by the appropriate official or the property has not been released within the 15-day time limit period, the claimant may file a petition in Federal district court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 983(f)(3). If a petition is filed in Federal district court, the claimant must send a copy of the petition to the appropriate official to whom the hardship petition was originally submitted and to the U.S. Attorney in the judicial district where the judicial petition was filed.
</P>
<P>(6) If a civil forfeiture complaint is filed on property and the claimant files a claim with the court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 983(a)(4)(A) and Rule G(5) of the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims, a hardship petition may be submitted to the individual identified in the public or personal notice of the civil forfeiture action.
</P>
<P>(n) <I>Disposition of property before forfeiture.</I> (1) Whenever it appears to the Postal Inspection Service that any seized property is liable to perish or to waste, or to be greatly reduced in value during its detention for forfeiture, or that the expense of keeping the property is or will be disproportionate to its value, the Chief Counsel for the Postal Inspection Service may order destruction, sale, or other disposition of such property prior to forfeiture. In addition, the owner may obtain release of the property by posting a substitute monetary amount with the Postal Inspection Service to be held subject to forfeiture proceedings in place of the seized property to be released. Upon approval by the Chief Counsel for the Postal Inspection Service, the property will be released to the owner upon the payment of an amount equal to the Government appraised value of the property if the property is not evidence of a violation of law, is not contraband, and has no design or other characteristics that particularly suit it for use in illegal activities. This payment must be in the form of a money order, an official bank check, or a cashier's check made payable to the Postal Inspection Service. A bond in the form of a cashier's check or official bank check will be considered as paid once the check has been accepted for payment by the financial institution that issued the check. If a substitute amount is posted and the property is administratively forfeited, the Postal Inspection Service will forfeit the substitute amount in lieu of the property. The pre-forfeiture destruction, sale, or other disposition of seized property pursuant to this subsection shall not extinguish any person's rights to the value of the property under applicable law. The authority vested in the Chief Counsel for the Postal Inspection Service under this subsection may not be delegated.
</P>
<P>(2) The Postal Inspection Service shall commence forfeiture proceedings, regardless of the disposition of the property under this paragraph. A person with an interest in the property that was destroyed or otherwise disposed of under this paragraph may file a claim to contest the forfeiture of the property or a petition for remission or mitigation of the forfeiture. No employee of the Postal Inspection Service shall be liable for the destruction or other disposition of property made pursuant to this paragraph. The destruction or other disposition of the property does not impair <I>in rem</I> jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>(o) <I>Declaration of administrative forfeiture.</I> If the Postal Inspection Service commences a timely proceeding against property subject to administrative forfeiture, and no valid and timely claim is filed, the appropriate official shall declare the property forfeited. The declaration of forfeiture shall have the same force and effect as a final decree and order of forfeiture in a Federal judicial forfeiture proceeding.
</P>
<P>(p) <I>Return of property.</I> (1) If, under 18 U.S.C. 983(a)(3), the Postal Inspection Service is notified by the U.S. Attorney in charge of the matter that the 90-day deadline was not met, the Postal Inspection Service is required to release the seized property. Under this subsection, the Postal Inspection Service is not required to return property for which it has an independent basis for continued custody including, but not limited to, contraband or evidence of a violation of law.
</P>
<P>(2) Upon becoming aware that the seized property must be released, the Postal Inspection Service shall promptly notify the person with a right to immediate possession of the property, informing that person to contact the property custodian within a specified period for release of the property, and further informing that person that failure to contact the property custodian within the specified period for release of the property may result in the initiation of abandonment proceedings against the property pursuant to 39 CFR part 946. The property custodian will be notified of the identity of the person to whom the property should be released.
</P>
<P>(3) The property custodian shall have the right to require presentation of proper identification or to verify the identity of the person who seeks the release of property.
</P>
<P>(q) <I>Disposition of forfeited property.</I> (1) Whenever property is forfeited administratively, the Postal Inspection Service may:
</P>
<P>(i) Retain the property for official use;
</P>
<P>(ii) Transfer ownership of the property to any Federal, state or local law enforcement agency that participated in the investigation leading to the forfeiture;
</P>
<P>(iii) Sell any property that is not required to be destroyed by law and that is not harmful to the public;
</P>
<P>(iv) Destroy the property; or
</P>
<P>(v) Dispose of the property as otherwise permitted by law.
</P>
<P>(2) If the laws of a state in which an article of forfeited property is located prohibit the sale or possession of such property, or if the Postal Service and the Marshals Service are of the opinion that it would be more advantageous to sell the forfeited property in another district, the property may be moved to and sold in such other district.
</P>
<P>(r) <I>Attorney fees and costs.</I> The Postal Inspection Service is not liable for attorney fees or costs in any administrative forfeiture proceeding, including such proceedings in which a claim is filed, the matter is referred to the U.S. Attorney, and the U.S. Attorney declines to commence judicial forfeiture proceedings.

<DIV8 N="§ 233.8" NODE="39:1.0.1.4.22.0.1.8" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 233.8   Expedited forfeiture proceedings for property seizures based on violations involving the possession of personal use quantities of a controlled substance.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Purpose and scope.</I> (1) The following definitions, regulations, and criteria are designed to establish and implement procedures required by section 6079 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Public Law 100-690, 102 Stat. 4181. They are intended to supplement existing law and procedures relative to the forfeiture of property under the identified statutory authority. These regulations do not affect the existing legal and equitable rights and remedies of those with an interest in property seized for forfeiture, nor do these provisions relieve interested parties from their existing obligations and responsibilities in pursuing their interests through such courses of action. These regulations are intended to reflect the intent of Congress to minimize the adverse impact on those entitled to legal or equitable relief occasioned by the prolonged detention of property subject to forfeiture due to violations of law involving personal use quantities of controlled substances. The definition of personal use quantities of a controlled substance as contained herein is intended to distinguish between those small quantities, which are generally considered to be possessed for personal consumption and not for further distribution, and those larger quantities generally considered to be subject to further distribution.
</P>
<P>(2) In this regard, for violations involving the possession of personal use quantities of a controlled substance, section 6079(b)(2) requires either that administrative forfeiture be completed within 21 days of the seizure of the property, or alternatively, that procedures are established that provide a means by which an individual entitled to relief may initiate an expedited administrative review of the legal and factual basis of the seizure for forfeiture. Should an individual request relief pursuant to these regulations and be entitled to the return of the seized property, such property shall be returned immediately following that determination, but not later than 20 days after filing of a petition for expedited release by an owner, and the administrative forfeiture process shall cease. Should the individual not be entitled to the return of the seized property, however, the administrative forfeiture of that property shall proceed. The owner may, in any event, obtain release of property pending the administrative forfeiture by submitting to the agency making the determination property sufficient to preserve the Government's vested interest for purposes of the administrative forfeiture.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Definitions.</I> As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings specified:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Commercial fishing industry vessel</I> means a vessel that:
</P>
<P>(i) Commercially engages in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish or an activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish;
</P>
<P>(ii) Commercially prepares fish or fish products other than by gutting, decapitating, gilling, skinning, shucking, icing, freezing, or brine chilling; or
</P>
<P>(iii) Commercially supplies, stores, refrigerates, or transports fish, fish products, or materials directly related to fishing or the preparation of fish to or from a fishing, fish processing, or fish tender vessel or fish processing facility.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Controlled substance</I> has the meaning given in 21 U.S.C. 802(6).
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Normal and customary manner</I> means that inquiry suggested by particular facts and circumstances that would customarily be undertaken by a reasonably prudent individual in a like or similar situation. Actual knowledge of such facts and circumstances is unnecessary, and implied, imputed, or constructive knowledge is sufficient. An established norm, standard, or custom is persuasive but not conclusive or controlling in determining whether an owner acted in a normal and customary manner to ascertain how property would be used by another legally in possession of the property. The failure to act in a normal and customary manner as defined herein will result in the denial of a petition for expedited release of the property and is intended to have the desirable effect of inducing owners of the property to exercise greater care in transferring possession of their property.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Owner</I> means one having a legal and possessory interest in the property seized for forfeiture. Even though one may hold primary and direct title to the property seized, such person may not have sufficient actual beneficial interest in the property to support a petition as owner if the facts indicate that another person had dominion and control over the property.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Personal use quantities</I> means those amounts of controlled substances in possession in circumstances where there is no other evidence of an intent to distribute, or to facilitate the manufacturing, compounding, processing, delivering, importing, or exporting of any controlled substance.
</P>
<P>(i) Evidence that possession of quantities of a controlled substance is for other than personal use may include, for example:
</P>
<P>(A) Evidence, such as drug scales, drug distribution paraphernalia, drug records, drug packaging material, method of drug packaging, drug “cutting” agents and other equipment, that indicates an intent to process, package, or distribute a controlled substance;
</P>
<P>(B) Information from reliable sources indicating possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute;
</P>
<P>(C) The arrest or conviction record of the person or persons in actual or constructive possession of the controlled substance for offenses under Federal, state, or local law that indicates an intent to distribute a controlled substance;
</P>
<P>(D) Circumstances or reliable information indicating that the controlled substance is related to large amounts of cash or any amount of prerecorded Government funds;
</P>
<P>(E) Circumstances or reliable information indicating that the controlled substance is a sample intended for distribution in anticipation of a transaction involving large quantities, or is part of a larger delivery;
</P>
<P>(F) Statements by the possessor, or otherwise attributable to the possessor, including statements of conspirators, that indicate possession with intent to distribute; or
</P>
<P>(G) The fact that the controlled substance was recovered from sweepings.
</P>
<P>(ii) Possession of a controlled substance shall be presumed to be for personal use when there are no indicia of illicit drug trafficking or distribution —such as, but not limited to, the factors listed above—and the amounts do not exceed the following quantities:
</P>
<P>(A) One gram of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of heroin;
</P>
<P>(B) One gram of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the following:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) Coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivations of ecgonine or their salts have been removed;
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) Cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers;
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) Ecgonine, its derivatives, their salts, isomers, and salts of isomers; or
</P>
<P>(<I>4</I>) Any compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any quantity of any of the substances referred to in (ii)(B)(1) through (ii)(B)(3) of this definition;
</P>
<P>(C) One-tenth gram of a mixture or substance described in (ii)(B) of this definition that contains cocaine base;
</P>
<P>(D) One-tenth gram of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of phencyclidine (PCP);
</P>
<P>(E) Five hundred micrograms of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD);
</P>
<P>(F) One ounce of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana;
</P>
<P>(G) One gram of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, and salts of its isomers, or one gram of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, or salts of its isomers.
</P>
<P>(iii) The possession of a narcotic, a depressant, a stimulant, a hallucinogen or a cannabis-controlled substance will be considered in excess of personal use quantities if the dosage unit amount possessed provides the same or greater equivalent efficacy as described in (ii)(B) of this definition.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Property</I> means property subject to forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. 881(a)(4), (6), or (7); 19 U.S.C. 1595a; or 49 U.S.C. 80303.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Seizing agency</I> means the Federal agency that has seized the property or adopted the seizure of another agency and has the responsibility for administratively forfeiting the property;
</P>
<P>(8) <I>Statutory rights or defenses to the forfeiture</I> means all legal and equitable rights and remedies available to a claimant of property seized for forfeiture.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Petition for expedited release in an administrative forfeiture proceeding.</I> (1) Where property is seized for administrative forfeiture involving controlled substances in personal use quantities, the owner may petition the Postal Inspection Service for expedited release of the property.
</P>
<P>(2) Where property described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is a commercial fishing industry vessel proceeding to or from a fishing area or intermediate port of call or actually engaged in fishing operations, which would be subject to seizure for administrative forfeiture for a violation of law involving controlled substances in personal use quantities, a summons to appear shall be issued in lieu of a physical seizure. The vessel shall report to the port designated in the summons. The Postal Inspection Service shall be authorized to effect administrative forfeiture as if the vessel had been physically seized. Upon answering the summons to appear on or prior to the last reporting date specified in the summons, the owner of the vessel may file a petition for expedited release pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) and other provisions in this section pertaining to a petition for expedited release shall apply as if the vessel had been physically seized.
</P>
<P>(3) The owner filing the petition for expedited release shall establish the following:
</P>
<P>(i) The owner has a valid, good faith interest in the seized property as owner or otherwise;
</P>
<P>(ii) The owner reasonably attempted to ascertain the use of the property in a normal and customary manner; and
</P>
<P>(iii) The owner did not know of or consent to the illegal use of the property, or in the event that the owner knew or should have known of the illegal use, the owner did what reasonably could be expected to prevent the violation.
</P>
<P>(4) In addition to those factors listed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, if an owner can demonstrate that the owner has other statutory rights or defenses that would cause the owner to prevail on the issue of forfeiture, such factors shall also be considered in ruling on the petition for expedited release.
</P>
<P>(5) A petition for expedited release must be received by the Postal Inspection Service within 20 days from the date of the first publication of the notice of seizure in ordered to be considered by the Postal Inspection Service. The petition must be executed and sworn to by the owner, and both the envelope and the request must be clearly marked “PETITION FOR EXPEDITED RELEASE.” Such petition shall be filed with the appropriate office or official identified in the personal written notice and the publication notice.
</P>
<P>(6) The petition shall include the following:
</P>
<P>(i) A complete description of the property, including identification numbers, if any, and the date and place of seizure;
</P>
<P>(ii) The petitioner's interest in the property, which shall be supported by title documentation, bills of sale, contracts, mortgages, or other satisfactory documentary evidence; and
</P>
<P>(iii) A statement of the facts and circumstances, to be established by satisfactory proof, relied upon by the petitioner to justify expedited release of the seized property.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Ruling on petition for expedited release in an administrative forfeiture proceeding.</I> (1) If a final administrative determination of the case, without regard to the provisions of this section, is made within 21 days of the seizure, the Postal Inspection Service need take no further action under this section on a petition for expedited release received pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) If no such final administrative determination is made within 21 days of the seizure, the following procedure shall apply. The Postal Inspection Service shall, within 20 days after the receipt of the petition for expedited release, determine whether the petition filed by the owner has established the factors listed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and:
</P>
<P>(i) If the Postal Inspection Service determines that those factors have been established, it shall terminate the administrative proceedings and return the property to the owner (or in the case of a commercial fishing industry vessel for which a summons has been issued shall dismiss the summons), except where it is evidence of a violation of law; or
</P>
<P>(ii) If the Postal Inspection Service determines that those factors have not been established, the agency shall proceed with the administrative forfeiture.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Posting of substitute monetary amount in an administrative forfeiture proceeding.</I> (1) Where property is seized for administrative forfeiture involving controlled substances in personal use quantities, the owner may obtain release of the property by posting a substitute monetary amount with the Postal Inspection Service to be held subject to forfeiture proceedings in place of the seized property to be released. The property will be released to the owner upon the payment of an amount equal to the Government-appraised value of the property if the property is not evidence of a violation of law and has no design or other characteristics that particularly suit it for use in illegal activities. This payment must be in the form of a traveler's check, a money order, a cashier's check, or an irrevocable letter of credit made payable to the Postal Inspection Service. A bond in the form of a cashier's check will be considered as paid once the check has been accepted for payment by the financial institution that issued the check.
</P>
<P>(2) If a substitute monetary amount is posted and the property is administratively forfeited, the Postal Inspection Service will forfeit the substitute amount in lieu of the property.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Notice provisions.</I> At the time of seizure of property defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section for violations involving the possession of personal use quantities of a controlled substance, the Postal Inspection Service must provide written notice to the possessor of the property specifying the procedures for filing of a petition for expedited release and for the posting of a substitute monetary bond as set forth in section 6079 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 and implementing regulations.

<DIV8 N="§ 233.9" NODE="39:1.0.1.4.22.0.1.9" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 233.9   Regulations governing remission or mitigation of administrative, civil, and criminal forfeitures.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Purpose, authority, and scope</I>—(1) <I>Purpose.</I> This section sets forth the procedures for Postal Inspection Service officials to follow when considering remission or mitigation of administrative forfeitures under the jurisdiction of the Postal Inspection Service. The purpose of these regulations is to provide a basis for the partial or total remission of forfeiture for individuals who have an interest in the forfeited property but who did not participate in, or have knowledge of, the conduct that resulted in the property being subject to forfeiture and, where required, took all reasonable steps under the circumstances to ensure that such property would not be used, acquired, or disposed of contrary to law. Additionally, the regulations provide for partial or total mitigation of the forfeiture and imposition of alternative conditions in appropriate circumstances.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Authority to grant remission and mitigation.</I> (i) Remission and mitigation functions in administrative forfeitures under the jurisdiction of the Postal Inspection Service are performed by the Chief Counsel.
</P>
<P>(ii) Remission and mitigation functions in judicial cases are performed by the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. Within the Criminal Division, authority to grant remission and mitigation is delegated to the Chief, Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section.
</P>
<P>(iii) The powers and responsibilities delegated by the regulations in this section may be re-delegated to attorneys or managers working under the supervision of the Chief Counsel.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Scope.</I> This section governs any petition for remission filed with the Postal Inspection Service and supersedes any Postal Service regulation governing petitions for remission, to the extent such regulation is inconsistent with this section.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Applicability.</I> The time periods and internal requirements established in this section are designed to guide the orderly administration of the remission and mitigation process and are not intended to create rights or entitlements in favor of individuals seeking remission or mitigation. The regulations will apply to all forfeiture actions commenced on or after May 1, 2012.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Definitions.</I> As used in this section:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Administrative forfeiture</I> means the process by which property may be forfeited by the Postal Inspection Service rather than through judicial proceedings. Administrative forfeiture has the same meaning as “nonjudicial forfeiture,” as that term is used in 18 U.S.C. 983.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Appraised value</I> means the estimated market value of an asset at the time and place of seizure if such or similar property was freely offered for sale between a willing seller and a willing buyer.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Assets Forfeiture Fund</I> means the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund, Department of the Treasury Assets Forfeiture Fund, or the Postal Service's Assets Forfeiture Fund, depending upon the identity of the seizing agency.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Attorney General</I> means the Attorney General of the United States or that official's designee.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Beneficial owner</I> means a person with actual use of, as well as an interest in, the property subject to forfeiture.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Chief, Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section,</I> and <I>Chief,</I> refer to the Chief of the Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section, Criminal Division, United States Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>General creditor</I> means one whose claim or debt is not secured by a specific right to obtain satisfaction against the particular property subject to forfeiture.
</P>
<P>(8) <I>Judgment creditor</I> means one who has obtained a judgment against the debtor but has not yet received full satisfaction of the judgment.
</P>
<P>(9) <I>Judicial forfeiture</I> means either a civil or a criminal proceeding in a United States District Court that may result in a final judgment and order of forfeiture.
</P>
<P>(10) <I>Lienholder</I> means a creditor whose claim or debt is secured by a specific right to obtain satisfaction against the particular property subject to forfeiture. A lien creditor qualifies as a lienholder if the lien:
</P>
<P>(i) Was established by operation of law or contract;
</P>
<P>(ii) Was created as a result of an exchange of money, goods, or services; and
</P>
<P>(iii) Is perfected against the specific property forfeited for which remission or mitigation is sought (e.g., a real estate mortgage; a mechanic's lien).
</P>
<P>(11) <I>Net equity</I> means the amount of a lienholder's monetary interest in the property subject to forfeiture. Net equity shall be computed by determining the amount of unpaid principal and unpaid interest at the time of seizure, and by adding to that sum unpaid interest calculated from the date of seizure through the last full month prior to the date of the decision on the petition. Where a rate of interest is set forth in a security agreement, the rate of interest to be used in this computation will be the annual percentage rate so specified in the security agreement that is the basis of the lienholder's interest. In this computation, however, there shall be no allowances for attorneys' fees, accelerated or enhanced interest charges, amounts set by contract as damages, unearned extended warranty fees, insurance, service contract charges incurred after the date of seizure, allowances for dealer's reserve, or any other similar charges.
</P>
<P>(12) <I>Nonjudicial forfeiture</I> has the same meaning as <I>administrative forfeiture</I> as defined in this section.
</P>
<P>(13) <I>Owner</I> means the person in who primary title is vested or whose interest is manifested by the actual and beneficial use of the property, even though the title is vested in another. A victim of an offense, as defined in paragraph (b)(22) of this section, may also be an owner if that person has a present legally cognizable ownership interest in the property forfeited. A nominal owner of property will not be treated as its true owner if that person is not its beneficial owner.
</P>
<P>(14) <I>Person</I> means an individual, partnership, corporation, joint business enterprise, estate, or other legal entity capable of owning property.
</P>
<P>(15) <I>Petition</I> means a petition for remission or mitigation of forfeiture under the regulations in this part. This definition includes a petition for restoration of the proceeds of sale of forfeited property and a petition for the value of the forfeited property placed into official use.
</P>
<P>(16) <I>Petitioner</I> means the person applying for remission, mitigation, restoration of the proceeds of sale, or for the appraised value of forfeited property, under this part. A petitioner may be an owner as defined in paragraph (b)(13) of this section, a lienholder as defined in paragraph (b)(10), or a victim as defined in paragraph (b)(22), subject to the limitations of paragraph (h) of this section.
</P>
<P>(17) <I>Property</I> means real or personal property of any kind capable of being owned or possessed.
</P>
<P>(18) <I>Record</I> means a series of arrests for related crimes, unless the arrestee was acquitted or the charges were dismissed for lack of evidence, a conviction for a related crime or completion of sentence within 10 years of the acquisition of the property subject to forfeiture, or two convictions for a related crime at any time in the past.
</P>
<P>(19) <I>Related crime</I> as used in paragraphs (b)(18) and (f) of this section means any crime similar in nature to that which gives rise to the seizure of property for forfeiture. For example, where property is seized for a violation of the Federal laws relating to drugs, a related crime would be any offense involving a violation of the Federal laws relating to drugs, or the laws of any state or political subdivision thereof relating to drugs.
</P>
<P>(20) <I>Related offense</I> as used in paragraph (h) of this section means:
</P>
<P>(i) Any predicate offense charged in a Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) count for which forfeiture was ordered; or
</P>
<P>(ii) An offense committed as part of the same scheme or design, or pursuant to the same conspiracy, as was involved in the offense for which forfeiture was ordered.
</P>
<P>(21) <I>Ruling Official</I> means any official to whom decision making authority has been delegated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
</P>
<P>(22) <I>Seizing agency</I> means any Federal agency that seized the property or adopted the seizure of another agency for Federal forfeiture.
</P>
<P>(23) <I>Victim</I> means a person who has incurred a pecuniary loss as a direct result of the commission of the offense underlying a forfeiture. A drug user is not considered a victim of a drug trafficking offense under this definition. A victim does not include one who acquires a right to sue the perpetrator of the criminal offense for any loss by assignment, subrogation, inheritance, or otherwise from the actual victim, unless that person has acquired an actual ownership interest in the forfeited property; provided however, that if a victim has received compensation from insurance or any other source with respect to a pecuniary loss, remission may be granted to the third party who provided compensation, up to the amount of the victim's pecuniary loss as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
</P>
<P>(24) <I>Violator</I> means the person whose use or acquisition of the property in violation of the law subjected such property to seizure for forfeiture.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Petitions in administrative forfeiture cases.</I> (1) <I>Notice of seizure.</I> The notice of seizure and intent to forfeit the property shall advise any persons who may have a present ownership interest in the property to submit their petitions for remission or mitigation within 30 days of the date they receive the notice in order to facilitate processing. Petitions shall be considered any time after notice until the property has been forfeited, except in cases involving petitions to restore the proceeds from the sale of forfeited property. A notice of seizure shall include the Ruling Official, the mailing and street address of the official to whom petitions should be sent, and an asset identifier number.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Persons who may file.</I> (i) A petition for remission or mitigation must be filed by a petitioner as defined in paragraph (b)(16) of this section, or as prescribed in paragraph (i)(7) and (8) of this section. A person or person acting on their behalf may not file a petition if, after notice or knowledge of the fact that a warrant or process has been issued for his apprehension, in order to avoid criminal prosecution the person:
</P>
<P>(A) Purposely leaves the jurisdiction of the United States;
</P>
<P>(B) Declines to enter or reenter the United States to submit to its jurisdiction; or
</P>
<P>(C) Otherwise evades the jurisdiction of the court in which a criminal matter is pending against the person.
</P>
<P>(ii) Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section applies to a petition filed by a corporation if any majority shareholder, or individual filing the claim on behalf of the corporation:
</P>
<P>(A) Purposely leaves the jurisdiction of the United States;
</P>
<P>(B) Declines to enter or reenter the United States to submit to its jurisdiction; or
</P>
<P>(C) Otherwise evades the jurisdiction of the court in which a criminal case is pending against the person.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Contents of petition.</I> (i) All petitions must include the following information in clear and concise terms:
</P>
<P>(A) The name, address, and social security or other taxpayer identification number of the person claiming an interest in the seized property who is seeking remission or mitigation;
</P>
<P>(B) The name of the seizing agency, the asset identifier number, and the date and place of seizure;
</P>
<P>(C) A complete description of the property, including make, model, and serial numbers, if any; and
</P>

</P>

</P>
<P>(B) Could not reasonably have known of the seizure prior to the entry of a final order of forfeiture.
</P>
<P>(ii) Such a petition must be submitted pursuant to paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(5) of this section within 90 days of the date the property was sold or otherwise disposed of.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Criteria governing administrative and judicial remission and mitigation</I>—(1) <I>Remission.</I> (i) The Ruling Official shall not grant remission of a forfeiture unless the petitioner establishes that the petitioner has a valid, good faith, and legally cognizable interest in the seized property as owner or lienholder as defined in this part and is an innocent owner within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 983(d)(2)(A) or (d)(3)(A).
</P>
<P>(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (e), the knowledge and responsibilities of a petitioner's representative, agent, or employee are imputed to the petitioner where the representative, agent, or employee was acting in the course of that person's employment and in furtherance of the petitioner's business.
</P>
<P>(iii) The petitioner has the burden of establishing the basis for granting a petition for remission or mitigation of forfeited property, a restoration of proceeds of sale or appraised value of forfeited property, or a reconsideration of a denial of such a petition. Failure to provide information or documents and to submit to interviews, as requested, may result in a denial of the petition.
</P>
<P>(iv) The Ruling Official shall presume a valid forfeiture and shall not consider whether the evidence is sufficient to support the forfeiture.
</P>
<P>(v) Willful, materially false statements or information made or furnished by the petitioner in support of a petition for remission or mitigation of forfeited property, the restoration of proceeds or appraised value of forfeited property, or the reconsideration of a denial of any such petition shall be grounds for denial of such petition and possible prosecution for the filing of false statements.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Mitigation.</I> (i) The Ruling Official may grant mitigation to a party not involved in the commission of the offense underlying forfeiture:
</P>
<P>(A) Where the petitioner has not met the minimum conditions for remission, but the Ruling Official finds that some relief should be granted to avoid extreme hardship, and that return of the property combined with imposition of monetary or other conditions of mitigation in lieu of a complete forfeiture will promote the interest of justice and will not diminish the deterrent effect of the law. Extenuating circumstances justifying such a finding include those circumstances that reduce the responsibility of the petitioner for knowledge of the illegal activity, knowledge of the criminal record of a user of the property, or failure to take reasonable steps to prevent the illegal use or acquisition by another for some reason, such as a reasonable fear of reprisal; or
</P>
<P>(B) Where the minimum standards for remission have been satisfied but the overall circumstances are such that, in the opinion of the Ruling Official, complete relief is not warranted.
</P>
<P>(ii) The Ruling Official may as a matter of discretion grant mitigation to a party involved in the commission of the offense underlying the forfeiture where certain mitigating factors exist, including, but not limited to: The lack of a prior record or evidence of similar criminal conduct; if the violation does not include drug distribution, manufacturing, or importation, the fact that the violator has taken steps, such as drug treatment, to prevent further criminal conduct; the fact that the violation was minimal and was not part of a larger criminal scheme; the fact that the violator has cooperated with Federal, state, or local investigations relating to the criminal conduct underlying the forfeiture; or the fact that complete forfeiture of an asset is not necessary to achieve the legitimate purposes of forfeiture.
</P>
<P>(iii) Mitigation may take the form of a monetary condition or the imposition of other conditions relating to the continued use of the property, and the return of the property, in addition to the imposition of any other costs that would be chargeable as a condition to remission. This monetary condition is considered as an item of cost payable by the petitioner, and shall be deposited into the Postal Inspection Service's Fund as an amount realized from forfeiture in accordance with the applicable statute. If the petitioner fails to accept the Ruling Official's mitigation decision or any of its conditions, or fails to pay the monetary amount within 20 days of the receipt of the decision, the property shall be sold, and the monetary amount imposed and other costs chargeable as a condition to mitigation shall be subtracted from the proceeds of the sale before transmitting the remainder to the petitioner.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Special rules for specific petitioners</I>—(1) <I>General creditors.</I> A general creditor may not be granted remission or mitigation of forfeiture unless that person otherwise qualifies as petitioner under this part.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Rival claimants.</I> If the beneficial owner of the forfeited property and the owner of a security interest in the same property each files a petition, and if both petitions are found to be meritorious, the claims of the beneficial owner shall take precedence.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Voluntary bailments.</I> A petitioner who allows another to use the petitioner's property without cost, and who is not in the business of lending money secured by property or of leasing or renting property for profit, shall be granted remission or mitigation of forfeiture in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Lessors.</I> A person engaged in the business of leasing or renting real or personal property on a long-term basis with the right to sublease shall not be entitled to remission or mitigation of a forfeiture of such property unless the lessor can demonstrate compliance with all the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Straw owners.</I> A petition by any person who has acquired a property interest recognizable under this part, and who knew or had reason to believe that the interest was conveyed by the previous owner for the purpose of circumventing seizure, forfeiture, or the regulations in this part, shall be denied. A petition by a person who purchases or owns property for another who has a record for related crimes as defined in paragraph (b)(19), or a petition by a lienholder who knows or has reason to believe that the purchaser or owner of record is not the real purchaser or owner, shall be denied unless both the purchaser of record and the real purchaser or owner meet the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Judgment creditors.</I> (i) A judgment creditor will be recognized as a lienholder if:
</P>
<P>(A) The judgment was duly recorded before the seizure of the property for forfeiture;
</P>
<P>(B) Under applicable state or other local law, the judgment constitutes a valid lien on the property that attached to it before the seizure of the property for forfeiture; and
</P>
<P>(C) The petitioner had no knowledge of the commission of any act or acts giving rise to the forfeiture at the time the judgment became a lien on the forfeited property.
</P>
<P>(ii) A judgment creditor will not be recognized as a lienholder if the property in question is not property of which the judgment debtor is entitled to claim ownership under applicable state or other local law (e.g., stolen property). A judgment creditor is entitled under this part to no more than the amount of the judgment, exclusive of any interest, costs, or other fees including attorney's fees associated with the action that led to the judgment or its collection.
</P>
<P>(iii) A judgment creditor's lien must be registered in the district where the property is located if the judgment was obtained outside the district.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Terms and conditions of remission and mitigation</I>—(1) <I>Owners.</I> (i) An owner's interest in property that has been forfeited is represented by the property itself or by a monetary interest equivalent to that interest at the time of seizure. Whether the property or a monetary equivalent will be remitted to an owner shall be determined at the discretion of the Ruling Official.
</P>
<P>(ii) If a civil judicial forfeiture action against the property is pending, release of the property must await an appropriate court order.
</P>
<P>(iii) Where the Government sells or disposes of the property prior to the grant of the remission, the owner shall receive the proceeds of that sale, less any costs incurred by the Government in the sale. The Ruling Official, as a matter of discretion, may waive the deduction of costs and expenses incident to the forfeiture.
</P>
<P>(iv) Where the owner does not comply with the conditions imposed upon release of the property by the Ruling Official, the property shall be sold. Following the sale, the proceeds shall be used to pay all costs of the forfeiture and disposition of the property, in addition to any monetary conditions imposed. The remaining balance shall be paid to the owner.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Lienholders.</I> (i) When the forfeited property is to be retained for official use or transferred to a state or local law enforcement agency or foreign government pursuant to law, and remission or mitigation has been granted to a lienholder, the recipient of the property shall assure that:
</P>
<P>(A) In the case of remission, the lien is satisfied as determined through the petition process; or
</P>
<P>(B) In the case of mitigation, an amount equal to the net equity, less any monetary conditions imposed, is paid to the lienholder prior to the release of the property to the recipient agency of foreign government.
</P>
<P>(ii) When the forfeited property is not retained for official use or transferred to another agency or foreign government pursuant to law, the lienholder shall be notified by the Ruling Official of the right to select either of the following alternatives:
</P>
<P>(A) <I>Return of Property.</I> The lienholder may obtain possession of the property after paying the United States, through the Ruling Official, the costs and expenses incident to the forfeiture, the amount, if any, by which the appraised value of the property exceeds the lienholder's net equity in the property, and any amount specified in the Ruling Official's decision as a condition to remit the property. The Ruling Official, as a matter of discretion, may waive costs and expenses incident to the forfeiture. The Ruling Official shall forward a copy of the decision, a memorandum of disposition, and the original releases to the division or field office responsible for the seizure and custody of the property or, if applicable, to the U.S. Marshals Service, who shall thereafter release the property to the lienholder; or
</P>
<P>(B) <I>Sale of Property and Payment to Lienholder.</I> Subject to the provisions of paragraph (i)(1) of this section, upon sale of the property, the lienholder may receive the payment of a monetary amount up to the sum of the lienholder's net equity, less the expenses and costs incident to the forfeiture and sale of the property, and any other monetary conditions imposed. The Ruling Official, as a matter of discretion, may waive costs and expenses incident to the forfeiture.
</P>
<P>(iii) If the lienholder does not notify the Ruling Official of the selection of one of the two options set forth in this paragraph (g)(2)(ii) within 20 days of the receipt of notification, the Ruling Official shall direct the division or field office responsible for the seizure or custody, or if applicable, the U.S. Marshals Service, to sell the property and pay the lienholder an amount up to the net equity, less the costs and expenses incurred incident to the forfeiture and sale, and any monetary conditions imposed. In the event a lienholder subsequently receives a payment of any kind on the debt owed for which he or she received payment as a result of the granting of remission or mitigation, the lienholder shall reimburse the Postal Service Forfeiture Fund to the extent of the payment received.
</P>
<P>(iv) Where the lienholder does not comply with the conditions imposed upon the release of the property, the property shall be sold after forfeiture. From the proceeds of the sale, all costs incident to the forfeiture and sale shall first be deducted, and the balance up to the net equity, less any monetary conditions, shall be paid to the lienholder.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Remission procedures for victims.</I> This section applies to victims of an offense underlying the forfeiture of property, or of a related offense, who do not have a present ownership interest in the forfeited property (or, in the case of multiple victims of an offense, who do not have a present ownership interest in the forfeited property that is clearly superior to that of other petitioner victims). This section applies only with respect to property forfeited pursuant to statutes that explicitly authorize restoration or remission of forfeited property to victims. A victim requesting remission under this section may concurrently request remission as an owner, pursuant to the regulations set forth in paragraphs (c), (d), and (g) of this section. The claims of victims granted remission as both an owner and victim shall, like other owners, have priority over the claims of any non-owner victims whose claims are recognized under this section.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Remission procedure for victims</I>—(i) <I>Where to file.</I> Persons seeking remission as victims shall file petitions for remission with the appropriate deciding official as described in paragraph (c)(5) (administrative forfeiture) or (d)(5) (judicial forfeiture) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Time of decision.</I> The Ruling Official or that person's designee as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may consider petitions filed by persons claiming eligibility for remission as victims at any time prior to the disposal of the forfeited property in accordance with law.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Request for reconsideration.</I> Persons denied remission under this section may request reconsideration of the denial, in accordance with paragraph (c)(10) (administrative forfeiture) or (d)(10) (judicial forfeiture) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Qualification to file.</I> A victim, as defined in paragraph (b)(22) of this section, may be granted remission, if in addition to complying with the other applicable provisions of this paragraph (h), the victim satisfactorily demonstrates that:
</P>
<P>(i) A pecuniary loss of a specific amount has been directly caused by the criminal offense, or related offense, that was the underlying basis for the forfeiture, and that the loss is supported by documentary evidence including invoices and receipts;
</P>
<P>(ii) The pecuniary loss is the direct result of the illegal acts and is not the result of otherwise lawful acts that were committed in the course of a criminal offense;
</P>
<P>(iii) The victim did not knowingly contribute to, participate in, benefit from, or act in a willfully blind manner towards commission of the offense, or related offense, that was the underlying basis of the forfeiture;
</P>
<P>(iv) The victim has not in fact been compensated for the wrongful loss of the property by the perpetrator or others; and
</P>
<P>(v) The victim does not have recourse reasonably available to other assets from which to obtain compensation for the wrongful loss of the property.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Pecuniary loss.</I> The amount of the pecuniary loss suffered by a victim for which remission may be granted is limited to the fair market value of the property of which the victim was deprived as of the date of the occurrence of the loss. No allowance shall be made for interest forgone or for collateral expenses incurred to recover lost property or to seek other recompense.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Torts.</I> A tort associated with illegal activity that formed the basis for the forfeiture shall not be a basis for remission, unless it constitutes the illegal activity itself, nor shall remission be granted for physical injuries to a petitioner or for damage to a petitioner's property.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Denial of petition.</I> As a matter of discretion, the Ruling Official may decline to grant remission where:
</P>
<P>(i) There is substantial difficulty in calculating the pecuniary loss incurred by the victim or victims;
</P>
<P>(ii) The amount of the remission, if granted, would be small compared with the amount of expenses incurred by the Government in determining whether to grant remission; or
</P>
<P>(iii) The total number of victims is large and the monetary amount of the remission so small as to make its granting impractical.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Pro rata basis.</I> In granting remission to multiple victims pursuant to this section, the Ruling Official should generally grant remission on a pro rata basis to recognized victims when petitions cannot be granted in full due to the limited value of the forfeited property. However, the Ruling Official may consider, among others, the following factors in establishing appropriate priorities in individual cases:
</P>
<P>(i) The specificity and reliability of the evidence establishing a loss;
</P>
<P>(ii) The fact that a particular victim is suffering an extreme financial hardship;
</P>
<P>(iii) The fact that a particular victim has cooperated with the Government in the investigation related to the forfeiture or to a related persecution or civil action; and
</P>
<P>(iv) In the case of petitions filed by multiple victims of related offenses, the fact that a particular victim is a victim of the offense underlying the forfeiture.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Reimbursement.</I> Any petitioner granted remission pursuant to this part shall reimburse the Postal Service Forfeiture Fund for the amount received, to the extent the individual later receives compensation for the loss of property from any other source. The petitioner shall surrender the reimbursement upon payment from any secondary source.
</P>
<P>(8) <I>Claims of financial institution regulatory agencies.</I> In cases involving property forfeitable under 18 U.S.C. 981(a)(1)(C) or (D), the Ruling Official may decline to grant a petition filed by a petitioner in whole or in part due to the lack of sufficient forfeitable funds to satisfy both the petitioner and claims of the financial institution regulatory agencies pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 981(e)(3) or (7). Generally, claims of financial institution regulatory agencies pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 981(e)(3) or (7) shall take priority over claims of victims.
</P>
<P>(9) <I>Amount of remission.</I> Consistent with the Assets Forfeiture Fund statute (28 U.S.C. 524(c)), the amount of remission shall not exceed the victim's share of the net proceeds of the forfeitures associated with the activity that caused the victim's loss. The calculation of net proceeds includes, but is not limited to, the deduction of allowable Government expenses and valid third-party claims.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Miscellaneous provisions</I>—(1) <I>Priority of payment.</I> Except where otherwise provided in this part, costs incurred by the Postal Inspection Service, the U.S. Marshals Service, and other agencies participating in the forfeiture that were incident to the forfeiture, sale, or other disposition of the property shall be deducted from the amount available for remission or mitigation. Such costs include, but are not limited to, court costs, storage costs, brokerage and other sales-related costs, the amount of any liens and associated costs paid by the Government on the property, costs incurred in paying the ordinary and necessary expenses of a business seized for forfeiture, awards for information as authorized by statute, expenses of trustees or other assistants pursuant to paragraph (i)(3) of this section, investigative or prosecutorial costs specially incurred incident to the particular forfeiture, and costs incurred incident to the processing of petitions for remission or mitigation. The remaining balance shall be available for remission or mitigation. The Ruling Official shall direct the distribution of the remaining balance in the following order or priority, except that the Ruling Official may exercise discretion in determining the priority between petitioners belonging to classes described in paragraph (i)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section in exceptional circumstances:
</P>
<P>(i) Owners;
</P>
<P>(ii) Lienholders;
</P>
<P>(iii) Federal financial institution regulatory agencies (pursuant to paragraph (i)(5) of this section), not constituting owners or lienholders; and
</P>
<P>(iv) Victims not constituting owners or lienholders pursuant to paragraph (h) of this part.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Sale or disposition of property prior to ruling.</I> If forfeited property has been sold or otherwise disposed of prior to a ruling, the Ruling Official may grant relief in the form of a monetary amount. The amount realized by the sale of property is presumed to be the value of the property. Monetary relief shall not be greater than the appraised value of the property at the time of seizure and shall not exceed the amount realized from the sale or other disposition. The proceeds of the sale shall be distributed as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) Payment of the Government's expenses incurred incident to the forfeiture and sale, including court costs and storage charges, if any;
</P>
<P>(ii) Payment to the petitioner of an amount up to that person's interest in the property;
</P>
<P>(iii) Payment to the Postal Service Forfeiture Fund of all other costs and expenses incident to the forfeiture;
</P>
<P>(iv) In the case of victims, payment of any amount up to the amount of that person's loss; and
</P>
<P>(v) Payment of the balance remaining, if any, to the Postal Service Forfeiture Fund.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Trustees and other assistants.</I> As a matter of discretion, the Ruling Official, with the approval of the Chief Postal Inspector, may use the services of a trustee, other Government official, or appointed contractors to notify potential petitioners, process petitions, and make recommendations to the Ruling Official on the distribution of property to petitioners. The expense for such assistance shall be paid out of the forfeited funds.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Other agencies of the United States.</I> Where another agency of the United States is entitled to remission or mitigation of forfeited assets because of an interest that is recognizable under this part or is eligible for such transfer pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 981(e)(6), such agency shall request the transfer in writing, in addition to complying with any applicable provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section. The decision to make such transfer shall be made in writing by the Ruling Official.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Financial institution regulatory agencies.</I> A Ruling Official may direct the transfer of property under 18 U.S.C. 981(e) to certain Federal financial institution regulatory agencies or an entity acting in their behalf, upon receipt of a written request, in lieu of ruling on a petition for remission or mitigation.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Transfers to foreign governments.</I> A Ruling Official may decline to grant remission to any petitioner other than an owner or lienholder so that forfeited assets may be transferred to a foreign government pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 981(i)(1); 19 U.S.C. 1616a(c)(2); or 21 U.S.C. 881(e)(1)(E).
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Filing by attorneys.</I> (i) A petition for remission or mitigation may be filed by a petitioner or by that person's attorney or legal guardian. If an attorney files on behalf of the petitioner, the petition must include a signed and sworn statement by the client-petitioner stating that:
</P>
<P>(A) The attorney has the authority to represent the petitioner in this proceeding;
</P>
<P>(B) The petitioner has fully reviewed the petition; and
</P>
<P>(C) The petition is truthful and accurate in every respect.
</P>
<P>(ii) Verbal notification of representation is not acceptable. Responses and notification of rulings shall not be sent to an attorney claiming to represent a petitioner unless a written notice of representation is filed. No extensions of time shall be granted due to delays in submission of the notice of representation.
</P>
<P>(8) <I>Consolidated petitions.</I> At the discretion of the Ruling Official in individual cases, a petition may be filed by one petitioner on behalf of other petitioners, provided the petitions are based on similar underlying facts, and the petitioner who files the petition has written authority to do so on behalf of other petitioners. This authority must be either expressed in documents giving the petitioner the authority to file petitions for remission, or reasonably implied from documents giving the petitioner express authority to file claims or lawsuits related to the course of conduct in question on behalf of these petitioners. An insurer or an administrator of an employee benefit plan, for example, which itself has standing to file a petition as a “victim” within the meaning of paragraph (b)(22) of this section, may also file a petition on behalf of its insured or plan beneficiaries for any claims they may have based on co-payments made to the perpetrator of the offense underlying the forfeiture, or the perpetrator of a “related offense” within the meaning of paragraph (b)(20), if the authority to file claims or lawsuits is contained in the document or documents establishing the plan. Where such a petition is filed, any amounts granted as remission must be transferred to the other petitioners, not the party filing the petition; although, as a matter of discretion, the Ruling Official may use the actual petitioner as an intermediary for transferring the amounts authorized as a remission to the other petitioners.

<HEAD>§ 241.3   Discontinuance of USPS-operated retail facilities.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Introduction</I>—(1) <I>Coverage.</I> (i) This section establishes the rules governing the Postal Service's consideration of whether an existing retail Post Office, station, or branch should be discontinued. The rules cover any proposal to:
</P>
<P>(A) Replace a USPS-operated Post Office, station, or branch with a contractor-operated retail facility;
</P>
<P>(B) Combine a USPS-operated Post Office, station, or branch with another USPS-operated retail facility; or
</P>
<P>(C) Discontinue a USPS-operated Post Office, station, or branch without providing a replacement facility.
</P>
<P>(ii) The conversion of a Post Office into, or the replacement of a Post Office with, another type of USPS-operated retail facility is not a discontinuance action subject to this section. A change in the staffing of a Post Office such that it is staffed only part-time by a postmaster, or not staffed at all by a postmaster, but rather by another type of USPS employee, is not a discontinuance action subject to this section.
</P>
<P>(iii) The regulations in this section are mandatory only with respect to discontinuance actions for which initial feasibility studies have been initiated on or after July 14, 2011. Unless otherwise provided by responsible personnel, the rules under § 241.3 as in effect prior to July 14, 2011, shall apply to discontinuance actions for which initial feasibility studies have been initiated prior to July 14, 2011. Discontinuance actions pending as of December 1, 2011, that pertain to the conversion of a Post Office to another type of USPS-operated facility are no longer subject to these regulations.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Definitions.</I> As used in this section, the terms listed below are defined as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) <I>“USPS-operated retail facility”</I> includes any Postal Service employee-operated Post Office, station, or branch, but does not include any station, branch, community Post Office, or other retail facility operated by a contractor.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>“Contractor-operated retail facility”</I> includes any station, branch, community Post Office, or other facility, including a private business, offering retail postal services that is operated by a contractor, and does not include any USPS-operated retail facility.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>“Closing”</I> means an action in which Post Office operations are permanently discontinued without providing a replacement facility in the community.
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>“Consolidation”</I> means an action that converts a Postal Service-operated retail facility into a contractor-operated retail facility. The resulting contractor-operated retail facility reports to a Postal Service-operated retail facility.
</P>
<P>(v) <I>“Discontinuance”</I> means either a closure or a consolidation.
</P>
<P>(vi) A <I>“Remotely Managed Post Office”</I> (RMPO) is a Post Office that offers part-time window service hours, is staffed by a Postal Service employee at the direction of a postmaster, and reports to an Administrative Post Office. Unless otherwise specified, all references to “Post Office” include RMPOs. The classification of a Post Office as an RMPO is not a discontinuance action under this section.
</P>
<P>(vii) A <I>“Part-Time Post Office”</I> (PTPO) is a Post Office that offers part-time window service hours, is staffed by a Postal Service employee, and reports to a district office. Unless otherwise specified, all references to “Post Office” include PTPOs. The classification of a Post Office as a PTPO is not a discontinuance action under this section.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Requirements.</I> A District Manager or the responsible Headquarters Vice President, or a designee of either, may initiate a feasibility study of a USPS-operated facility for possible discontinuance. Any decision to close or consolidate a USPS-operated retail facility may be effected only upon the consideration of certain factors. These include the effect on the community served; the effect on employees of the USPS-operated retail facility; compliance with government policy established by law that the Postal Service must provide a maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural areas, communities, and small towns where Post Offices are not self-sustaining; the economic savings to the Postal Service; and any other factors the Postal Service determines necessary. In addition, certain mandatory procedures apply as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) The public must be given 60 days' notice of a proposed action to enable the persons served by a USPS-operated retail facility to evaluate the proposal and provide comments.
</P>
<P>(ii) After public comments are received and taken into account, any final determination to close or consolidate a USPS-operated retail facility must be made in writing and must include findings covering all the required considerations.
</P>
<P>(iii) The written determination must be made available to persons served by the USPS-operated retail facility at least 60 days before the discontinuance takes effect.
</P>
<P>(iv) Within the first 30 days after the written determination is made available, any person regularly served by a Post Office subject to discontinuance may appeal the decision to the Postal Regulatory Commission. Where persons regularly served by another type of USPS-operated retail facility subject to discontinuance file an appeal with the Postal Regulatory Commission, the General Counsel reserves the right to assert defenses, including the Commission's lack of jurisdiction over such appeals. For purposes of determining whether an appeal is filed within the 30-day period, receipt by the Commission is based on the postmark of the appeal, if sent through the mail, or on other appropriate documentation or indicia, if sent through another lawful delivery method.
</P>
<P>(v) The Commission may only affirm the Postal Service determination or return the matter for further consideration but may not modify the determination.
</P>
<P>(vi) The Commission is required to make any determination subject to 39 U.S.C. 404(d)(5) within the 120 days specified by statute.
</P>
<P>(vii) The following table summarizes the notice and appeal periods defined by statute.

<P>(4) <I>Additional requirements.</I> This section also includes:
</P>
<P>(i) Rules to ensure that the community's identity as a postal address is preserved.
</P>
<P>(ii) Rules for consideration of a proposed discontinuance and for its implementation, if approved. These rules are designed to ensure that the reasons leading to discontinuance of a particular USPS-operated retail facility are fully articulated and disclosed at a stage that enables customer participation to make a helpful contribution toward the final decision.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Initial feasibility study.</I> A district manager, the responsible Headquarters vice president, or a designee of either may initiate a feasibility study of a USPS-operated retail facility's potential discontinuance, in order to assist the district manager in determining whether to proceed with a written proposal to discontinue the facility.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Permissible circumstances.</I> The initial feasibility study may be based upon circumstances including, but not limited to, the following:
</P>
<P>(A) A postmaster vacancy;
</P>
<P>(B) Emergency suspension of the USPS-operated retail facility due to cancellation of a lease or rental agreement when no suitable alternate quarters are available in the community, a fire or natural disaster, irreparable damage when no suitable alternate quarters are available in the community, challenge to the sanctity of the mail, or similar reasons;
</P>
<P>(C) Earned workload below the minimum established level for the lowest level RMPO;
</P>
<P>(D) Insufficient customer demand, evidenced by declining or low volume, revenue, revenue units, local business activity, or local population trends;
</P>
<P>(E) The availability of reasonable alternate access to postal services for the community served by the USPS-operated retail facility; or
</P>
<P>(F) The incorporation of two communities into one or other special circumstances.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Impermissible circumstances.</I> The following circumstances may not be used to justify initiation of an initial feasibility study:
</P>
<P>(A) Any claim that the continued operation of a building without handicapped modifications is inconsistent with the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151 <I>et seq.</I>);
</P>
<P>(B) The absence of running water or restroom facilities;
</P>
<P>(C) Compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 <I>et seq.</I>); or
</P>
<P>(D) In the absence of any circumstances identified in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section, the operation of a small Post Office at a deficit.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Notice to customers.</I> Local management must provide notification and questionnaires to customers at the USPS-operated retail facility under study. Local management may determine whether notification is appropriate through media outlets. In addition, the following customers that receive delivery service from the USPS-operated retail facility must receive notification and questionnaires by mail:
</P>
<P>(A) Post Office Box customers at the USPS-operated retail facility under study;
</P>
<P>(B) Customers whose delivery carrier is stationed out of the USPS-operated retail facility under study;
</P>
<P>(C) Customers in the delivery area of the same ZIP Code as the retail facility under study, regardless of whether the delivery carriers for those customers are stationed out of the retail facility under study or out of a nearby facility; and
</P>
<P>(D) Customers whom the retail facility under study serves for allied delivery services such as mail pickup.
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>Initial feasibility study due to emergency suspension.</I> Wherever possible when an initial feasibility study is to be initiated under § 241.3(a)(5)(i)(B) (for example, when it is anticipated that a lease or rental agreement will be cancelled with no suitable alternate quarters available in the community), responsible personnel should initiate the initial feasibility study sufficiently in advance of the circumstance prompting the emergency suspension to allow a meaningful opportunity for public input to be taken into account. If public input cannot be sought sufficiently in advance of the end date of the lease or rental agreement, responsible personnel should endeavor, to the extent possible, to continue operation of the USPS-operated retail facility for the duration necessary to gather public input and make a more fully informed decision on whether to proceed with a discontinuance proposal. Customers formerly served by the suspended facility should receive notice under paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, including by mail, to the same extent that they would have if the facility were not in suspended status at the time of the initial feasibility study, proposal, or final determination.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Preservation of community address</I>—(1) <I>Policy.</I> The Postal Service permits the use of a community's separate address to the extent practicable.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>ZIP Code assignment.</I> The ZIP Code for each address formerly served from the discontinued USPS-operated retail facility should be kept, wherever practical. In some cases, the ZIP Code originally assigned to the discontinued USPS-operated retail facility may be changed if the responsible District Manager receives approval from his or her Vice President of Area Delivery and Retail Operations before any proposal to discontinue the USPS-operated retail facility is posted.
</P>
<P>(i) In a consolidation, the ZIP Code for the replacement contractor-operated retail facility is the ZIP Code originally assigned to the discontinued facility.
</P>
<P>(ii) If the ZIP Code is changed and the parent or gaining USPS-operated retail facility covers several ZIP Codes, the ZIP Code must be that of the delivery area within which the facility is located.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>USPS-operated retail facility's city name in address.</I> If all the delivery addresses using the city name of the USPS-operated retail facility being discontinued continue to use the same ZIP Code, customers may continue to use the discontinued facility's city name in their addresses, instead of that of the new delivering USPS-operated retail facility.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Name of facility established by consolidation.</I> If a USPS-operated retail facility is consolidated by establishing in its place a contractor-operated facility, the replacement unit can be given the same name of the facility that is replaced, if appropriate in light of the nature of the contract and level of service provided.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Initial proposal</I>—(1) <I>In general.</I> If a District Manager believes that the discontinuance of a USPS-operated retail facility within his or her responsibility may be warranted, the District Manager:
</P>
<P>(i) Must use the standards and procedures in § 241.3(c) and (d).
</P>
<P>(ii) Must investigate the situation.
</P>
<P>(iii) May propose the USPS-operated retail facility be discontinued.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Consolidation.</I> The proposed action may include a consolidation of USPS-operated retail facilities. A consolidation arises when a USPS-operated retail facility is replaced with a contractor-operated retail facility.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Views of postmasters.</I> Whether the discontinuance under consideration involves a consolidation or not, the District Manager must discuss the matter with the postmaster (or the officer in charge) of the USPS-operated retail facility considered for discontinuance, and with the postmaster of any other USPS-operated retail facility affected by the change. The District Manager should make sure that these officials are invited to submit written comments and suggestions as part of the record when the proposal is reviewed.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Preparation of written proposal.</I> The District Manager, or a designee, must gather and preserve for the record all documentation used to assess the proposed change. If the District Manager thinks the proposed action is warranted, he or she, or a designee, must prepare a document titled “Proposal to (Close) (Consolidate) the (Facility Name).” This document must describe, analyze, and justify in sufficient detail to Postal Service management and affected customers the proposed service change. The written proposal must address each of the following matters in separate sections:
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Responsiveness to community postal needs.</I> It is the policy of the Government, as established by law, that the Postal Service will provide a maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural areas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not self-sustaining. The proposal should:
</P>
<P>(A) Contrast the services available before and after the proposed change;
</P>
<P>(B) Describe how the changes respond to the postal needs of the affected customers; and
</P>
<P>(C) Highlight particular aspects of customer service that might be less advantageous as well as more advantageous.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Effect on community.</I> The proposal must include an analysis of the effect the proposed discontinuance might have on the community served, and discuss the application of the requirements in § 241.3(b).
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Effect on employees.</I> The written proposal must summarize the possible effects of the change on postmasters and other employees of the USPS-operated retail facility considered for discontinuance.
</P>
<P>(iv) <I>Savings.</I> The proposal must include an analysis of the economic savings to the Postal Service from the proposed action, including the cost or savings expected from each major factor contributing to the overall estimate.
</P>
<P>(v) <I>Other factors.</I> The proposal should include an analysis of other factors that the District Manager determines are necessary for a complete evaluation of the proposed change, whether favorable or unfavorable.
</P>
<P>(vi) <I>Summary.</I> The proposal must include a summary that explains why the proposed action is necessary, and assesses how the factors supporting the proposed change outweigh any negative factors. In taking competing considerations into account, the need to provide regular and effective service is paramount.
</P>
<P>(vii) <I>Notice.</I> The proposal must include the following notices:
</P>
<P>(A) <I>Supporting materials.</I> “Copies of all materials on which this proposal is based are available for public inspection at (Facility Name) during normal office hours.”
</P>
<P>(B) <I>Nature of posting.</I> “This is a proposal. It is not a final determination to (close) (consolidate) this facility.”
</P>
<P>(C) <I>Posting of final determination.</I> “If a final determination is made to close or consolidate this facility, after public comments on this proposal are received and taken into account, a notice of that final determination will be posted in this facility.”
</P>
<P>(D) <I>Appeal rights.</I> “The final determination will contain instructions on how affected customers may appeal a decision to close or consolidate a post office to the Postal Regulatory Commission. Any such appeal must be received by the Commission within 30 days of the posting of the final determination.” The notice in this clause is provided when the USPS-operated retail facility under study is a post office. For purposes of this clause, the date of receipt by the Commission is based on the postmark of the appeal, if sent through the mail, or on other appropriate documentation or indicia, if sent through another lawful delivery method.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Notice, public comment, and record</I>—(1) <I>Posting proposal and comment notice.</I> A copy of the written proposal and a signed invitation for comments must be posted prominently, with additional copies to be given to customers upon request, in the following locations:
</P>
<P>(i) The USPS-operated retail facility under study, unless service at the facility has been suspended;
</P>
<P>(ii) The USPS-operated retail facility proposed to serve as the supervising facility;
</P>
<P>(iii) Any USPS-operated retail facility likely to serve a significant number of customers of the USPS-operated retail facility under study; and
</P>
<P>(iv) If service at the facility under study has been suspended, any USPS-operated retail facility providing alternative service for former customers of the facility under study.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Contents of comment notice.</I> The invitation for comments must:
</P>
<P>(i) Ask interested persons to provide written comments within 60 days, to a stated address, offering specific opinions and information, favorable or unfavorable, on the potential effect of the proposed change on postal services and the community.
</P>
<P>(ii) State that copies of the proposal with attached optional comment forms are available in the affected USPS-operated retail facilities.
</P>
<P>(iii) Provide a name and telephone number to call for information.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Other steps.</I> In addition to providing notice and inviting comment, the District Manager must take any other steps necessary to ensure that the persons served by affected USPS-operated retail facilities understand the nature and implications of the proposed action. A community meeting must be held to provide outreach and gain public input after the proposal is posted, unless otherwise instructed by the responsible Headquarters Vice President or the applicable Vice President of Area Delivery and Retail Operations. Authorization to forgo a community meeting should issue only where exceptional circumstances make a community meeting infeasible, such as where the community no longer exists because of a natural disaster or because residents have moved elsewhere.
</P>
<P>(i) If oral contacts develop views or information not previously documented, whether favorable or unfavorable to the proposal, the District Manager should encourage persons offering the views or information to provide written comments to preserve them for the record.
</P>
<P>(ii) As a factor in making his or her decision, the District Manager may not rely on communications received from anyone unless submitted in writing for the record.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Record.</I> The District Manager must keep, as part of the record for consideration and review, all documentation gathered about the proposed change.
</P>
<P>(i) The record must include all information that the District Manager considered, and the decision must stand on the record. No written information or views submitted by customers may be excluded.
</P>
<P>(ii) The docket number assigned to the proposal must be the ZIP Code of the office proposed for closing or consolidation.
</P>
<P>(iii) The record must include a chronological index in which each document contained is identified and numbered as filed.
</P>
<P>(iv) As written communications are received in response to the public notice and invitation for comments, they are included in the record.
</P>
<P>(v) A complete copy of the record must be available for public inspection during normal office hours at the USPS-operated retail facilities where the proposal was posted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, beginning no later than the date on which notice is posted and extending through the posting period. When appropriate, certain personally identifiable information, such as individual names or residential addresses, may be redacted from the publicly accessible copy of the record.
</P>
<P>(vi) Copies of documents in the record (except the proposal and comment form) are provided on request and on payment of fees as noted in chapter 4 of Handbook AS-353, <I>Guide to Privacy, the Freedom of Information Act, and Records Management.</I>
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Consideration of public comments and final local recommendation</I>—(1) <I>Analysis of comments.</I> The District Manager or a designee must prepare an analysis of the public comments received for consideration and inclusion in the record. If possible, comments subsequently received should also be included in the analysis. The analysis should list and briefly describe each point favorable to the proposal and each point unfavorable to the proposal. The analysis should identify to the extent possible how many comments support each point listed.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Re-evaluation of proposal.</I> After completing the analysis, the District Manager must review the proposal and re-evaluate all the tentative conclusions previously made in light of additional customer information and views in the record.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Discontinuance not warranted.</I> If the District Manager decides against the proposed discontinuance, he or she must post, in the USPS-operated retail facilities where the proposal was posted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a notice stating that the proposed closing or consolidation is not warranted.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Discontinuance warranted.</I> If the District Manager decides that the proposed discontinuance is justified, the appropriate sections of the proposal must be revised, taking into account the comments received from the public. After making necessary revisions, the District Manager must:
</P>
<P>(A) Transmit the revised proposal and the entire record to the responsible Headquarters Vice President.
</P>
<P>(B) Certify that all documents in the record are originals or true and correct copies.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Postal Service decision</I>—(1) <I>In general.</I> The responsible Headquarters Vice President or a designee must review the proposal of the District Manager and decide on the merits of the proposal. This review and the decision must be based on and supported by the record developed by the District Manager. The responsible Headquarters Vice President can instruct the District Manager to provide more information to supplement the record. Each instruction and the response must be added to the record. The decision on the proposal of the District Manager, which must also be added to the record, may approve or disapprove the proposal, or return it for further action as set forth in this paragraph (f).
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Approval.</I> The responsible Headquarters Vice President or a designee may approve the proposed discontinuance, with or without further revisions. If approved without further revision, the term “Final Determination” is substituted for “Proposal” in the title. A copy of the Final Determination must be provided to the District Manager. The Final Determination constitutes the Postal Service determination for the purposes of 39 U.S.C. 404(d).
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Supporting materials.</I> The Final Determination must include the following notice: “Copies of all materials on which this Final Determination is based are available for public inspection at the (Facility Name) during normal office hours.”
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Appeal rights.</I> If the USPS-operated retail facility subject to discontinuance is a post office, the Final Determination must include the following notice: “Pursuant to Public Law 94-421 (1976), this Final Determination to (close) (consolidate) the (Facility Name) may be appealed by any person served by that office to the Postal Regulatory Commission, 901 New York Avenue, NW., Suite 200, Washington, DC 20268-0001. Any appeal must be received by the Commission within 30 days of the first day this Final Determination was posted. If an appeal is filed, copies of appeal documents prepared by the Postal Regulatory Commission, or the parties to the appeal, must be made available for public inspection at the (Facility Name) during normal office hours.”
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Disapproval.</I> The responsible Headquarters Vice President or a designee may disapprove the proposed discontinuance and return it and the record to the District Manager with written reasons for disapproval. The District Manager or a designee must post, in each affected USPS-operated retail facility where the proposal was posted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a notice that the proposed closing or consolidation has been determined to be unwarranted.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Return for further action.</I> The responsible Headquarters Vice President or a designee may return the proposal of the District Manager with written instructions to give additional consideration to matters in the record, or to obtain additional information. Such instructions must be placed in the record.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Public file.</I> Copies of each Final Determination and each disapproval of a proposal by the responsible Headquarters Vice President must be placed on file in the Postal Service Headquarters library.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Implementation of final determination</I>—(1) <I>Notice of final determination to discontinue USPS-operated retail facility.</I> The District Manager must:
</P>
<P>(i) Provide notice of the Final Determination by posting a copy prominently in the USPS-operated retail facilities in each affected USPS-operated retail facilities where the proposal was posted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, including the USPS-operated retail facilities likely to be serving the affected customers. The date of posting must be noted on the first page of the posted copy as follows: “Date of posting.”
</P>
<P>(ii) Ensure that a copy of the completed record is available for public inspection during normal business hours at each USPS-operated retail facility where the Final Determination is posted for 30 days from the posting date.
</P>
<P>(iii) Provide copies of documents in the record on request and payment of fees as noted in chapter 4 of Handbook AS-353, <I>Guide to Privacy, the Freedom of Information Act, and Records Management.</I>
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Implementation of determinations not appealed.</I> If no appeal is filed, the official closing date of the office must be published in the <I>Postal Bulletin</I> and effective, at the earliest, 60 days after the first day that Final Determination was posted. A District Manager may request a different date for official discontinuance in the Retail Change Announcement document submitted to the responsible Headquarters Vice President or a designee. However, the USPS-operated retail facility may not be discontinued sooner than 60 days after the first day of the posting of the notice required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Actions during appeal</I>—(i) <I>Implementation of discontinuance.</I> If an appeal is filed, only the responsible Headquarters Vice President may direct a discontinuance before disposition of the appeal. However, the USPS-operated retail facility may not be permanently discontinued sooner than 60 days after the first day of the posting of the notice required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Display of appeal documents.</I> The Office of General Counsel must provide the District Manager with copies of all pleadings, notices, orders, briefs, and opinions filed in the appeal proceeding.
</P>
<P>(A) The District Manager must ensure that copies of all these documents are prominently displayed and available for public inspection in the USPS-operated retail facilities where the Final Determination was posted under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section. If the operation of that USPS-operated retail facility has been suspended, the District Manager must ensure that copies are displayed in the USPS-operated retail facilities likely to be serving the affected customers.
</P>
<P>(B) All documents except the Postal Regulatory Commission's final order and opinion must be displayed until the final order and opinion are issued. The final order and opinion must be displayed at the USPS-operated retail facility to be discontinued for 30 days or until the effective date of the discontinuance, whichever is earlier. The final order and opinion must be displayed for 30 days in all other USPS-operated retail facilities where the Final Determination was posted under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Actions following appeal decision</I> —(i) <I>Determination affirmed.</I> If the Commission dismisses the appeal or affirms the Postal Service's determination, the official closing date of the office must be published in the Postal Bulletin, effective anytime after the Commission renders its opinion, if not previously implemented under § 241.3(g)(3)(i). However, the USPS-operated retail facility may not be discontinued sooner than 60 days after the first day of the posting of the notice required under § 241.3(g)(1).
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Determination returned for further consideration.</I> If the Commission returns the matter for further consideration, the responsible Headquarters Vice President must direct that either:
</P>
<P>(A) Notice be provided under paragraph (f)(3) of this section that the proposed discontinuance is determined not to be warranted or
</P>
<P>(B) The matter be returned to an appropriate stage under this section for further consideration following such instructions as the responsible Headquarters Vice President may provide.

<DIV8 N="§ 241.4" NODE="39:1.0.1.4.24.0.1.4" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 241.4   Relocating retail services; adding new retail service facilities.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Application.</I> (1) Except as otherwise provided, this section applies when the Postal Service makes a tentative decision to relocate all retail services from a retail service facility to a separate physical building, or to add a new retail service facility for a community. As used in this section, “retail services” means the single-piece mail services offered to individual members of the public on a walk-in basis, and a “retail service facility” is a physical building where Postal Service employees provide such retail services.


</P>
<P>(2) This paragraph (a)(2) applies to temporary additions of retail service or relocations of retail service facilities, emergency relocations of retail services, provisional relocations of retail services, and relocations of retail services within the same development or following redevelopment of a site.


</P>
<P>(i) The Postal Service may implement temporary additions of retail service or relocations of retail service facilities without undertaking the process in paragraph (c) of this section when necessary to support Postal Service business for holidays, special events, or overflow business. Temporary additions of retail service and relocations of retail service facilities normally will be limited to 180 days in duration. Any additional incremental time periods of up to 180 days each must be approved by the Vice President, Facilities or his designee.
</P>
<P>(ii) The Postal Service may implement emergency relocations without first undertaking the process in paragraph (c) of this section when the Postal Service determines relocation is required to protect Postal Service business due to events such as earthquakes, floods, fire, potential or actual OSHA violations, safety factors, environmental causes, other business disrupting events, or as necessary to protect employees, customers, or the security of the mail. Following an emergency relocation, as soon as the Postal Service determines it is feasible to identify the long-term location for the retail services, the Postal Service will make a tentative decision to remain in the emergency relocation site on a long-term basis, to return to the original retail service facility (if feasible), or to relocate to another site. Unless the decision is to return to the original retail service facility, the Postal Service then will follow the process in paragraph (c) of this section with respect to collecting and considering community input on a proposal to implement that decision.
</P>
<P>(iii) The Postal Service may implement provisional relocations in connection with lease terminations or expirations, or in connection with a lessor exercising a right to require the Postal Service to move to alternate premises, when the Postal Service has not already undertaken the process in paragraph (c) of this section for such relocations. Not later than 180 days following a provisional relocation, the Postal Service will make a tentative decision to remain in the provisional relocation site on a long-term basis or to relocate to another site. After that decision, the Postal Service will follow the process in paragraph (c) of this section with respect to collecting and considering community input on a proposal to implement that decision.
</P>
<P>(iv) The Postal Service may implement relocations without undertaking the process in paragraph (c) of this section when the new retail service facility is within the same development as the relocated retail service facility. As used in this section, “development” means one or more commercial or mixed-use buildings that share an access point or points from a public right-of-way.
</P>
<P>(v) The Postal Service may implement relocations without undertaking the process in paragraph (c) of this section when the relocated retail service facility is within the same site following the redevelopment of the building or development in which the relocated retail service facility was located.
</P>
<P>(3) This section applies to tentative decisions described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section made on or after June 6, 2023. The rules under § 241.4 in effect prior to that date shall apply to projects described in paragraph (a) of this section undertaken prior to that date.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Purpose.</I> The purpose of this section is to provide opportunities for community members and their elected local officials to comment on Postal Service tentative decisions described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section and to give input on proposals for implementing those decisions (each a “proposal”), and to require the Postal Service to consider any input in arriving at final decisions to proceed with, modify, or cancel proposals.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Collecting and considering community input.</I> When the Postal Service makes a tentative decision described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, a Postal Service representative will take the following steps:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Identify the community and engage local elected officials.</I> The Postal Service representative will identify the community the Postal Service anticipates would be affected by implementing the proposal, taking into account such factors as the Postal Service determines are appropriate for the proposal. The Postal Service representative then will deliver to one or more local elected public officials a written outline of the proposal and offer to discuss the proposal with them. The Postal Service representative may elect to conduct that discussion either in person or using any other appropriate communication tool, including electronic communications. If the officials accept the offer, then the Postal Service representative will identify the need and outline the proposal that is under consideration to meet it, explain the process by which the Postal Service will solicit and consider input from the affected community, and solicit input from the local officials regarding the proposal.


</P>
<P>(2) <I>Notify the community.</I> The Postal Service will send an initial news release outlining the proposal to one or more news media serving the community and, if the community has a retail service facility, then the Postal Service also will post a copy of the information given to local officials or the news release in the public lobby of that retail service facility. If the proposal concerns relocating retail services from a leased facility, then, using the most current notice address information in the Postal Service's file for the site, the Postal Service will deliver to the lessor a copy of the information given to local officials, provided, however, that no such notice will be required when the lessor has terminated the Postal Service's lease or has declined to renew the Postal Service lease on terms acceptable to the Postal Service.


</P>
<P>(3) <I>Solicit comments from the community.</I> The Postal Service will mail written notification of the tentative decision and the proposal to customers within the community and post a notice of the proposal in the retail service facility that would be affected by the proposal, seeking their written input on the proposal and providing an address to which the community and local officials may send written comments on the proposal during the 45 days following the mailing of that notification.
</P>
<P>(i)(A) If the proposal concerns relocation, then the Postal Service will:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) Discuss the reasons for relocating;
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) Identify the site or area, or both, to which the Postal Service anticipates relocating the retail services; and
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) Describe the anticipated size of the retail service facility for the relocated retail services, and the anticipated services to be offered at that site or in that area.
</P>
<P>(B) The Postal Service may identify more than one potential relocation site and/or area, for example, when the Postal Service has not selected among competing sites.
</P>
<P>(ii)(A) If the proposal concerns adding a new retail service facility for a community, then the Postal Service will:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) Discuss the reasons for the addition;
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) Identify the site or area, or both, to which the Postal Service anticipates adding the retail service facility; and


</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) Describe the anticipated size of the added retail service facility, and the anticipated services to be offered.




</P>
<P>(B) The Postal Service may identify more than one potential site and/or area, for example, when the Postal Service has not selected yet among competing sites.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Consider comments.</I> After the 45-day comment period, the Postal Service will consider the comments received that identify reasons why the Postal Service's tentative decision and proposal (<I>e.g.,</I> to relocate to the selected site, or to add a new retail service facility) is, or is not, the optimal solution for the identified need. Following that consideration, the Postal Service will make a final decision to proceed with, modify, or cancel the proposal. The Postal Service then will inform local officials in writing of its final decision and send an initial news release announcing the final decision to local news media. If the community has a retail service facility, then the Postal Service also will post a copy of the information given to local officials or the news release in the public lobby of that retail service facility. The Postal Service then will implement the final decision.


</P>
<P>(5) <I>Identify any new site or area.</I> After the written notification under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, if the Postal Service decides to use a site or area that it did not identify in the written notification, and this section applies with respect to that new site or area, then the Postal Service will undertake the steps in paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) of this section with regard to the new site or area.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Effect on other obligations and policies.</I> (1) Nothing in this section shall add to, reduce, or otherwise modify the Postal Service's legal obligations or policies for compliance with:
</P>
<P>(i) Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 470, Executive Order 12072, and Executive Order 13006;
</P>
<P>(ii) 39 U.S.C. 404(d) and 39 CFR 241.3; or
</P>
<P>(iii) 39 U.S.C. 409(f);
</P>
<P>(2) These are independent policies or obligations of the Postal Service that are not dependent upon a relocation or addition of a retail service facility.

<DIV8 N="§ 254.2" NODE="39:1.0.1.4.27.0.1.2" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 254.2   Definition of primary function area and criteria used to determine whether an alteration has an effect on an area containing a primary function that is disproportionate to the overall alterations.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Terminology.</I> The new accessibility guidelines require that certain terms be defined by the participating federal agencies. In the U.S. Access Board's 36 CFR part 1191, Appendix C, ABA chapter 2, section F202.6.2 requires that “primary function areas” be defined and Section F202.4 contains requirements for alterations affecting “primary function areas” stating, “* * *an alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area, including the rest rooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, unless such alterations are disproportionate to the overall alterations in terms of cost and scope as determined under criteria established by the Administrator of * * * the United States Postal Service.”
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Primary function areas.</I> For purposes of this part, the primary function of the Postal Service is to provide mail service for its customers, that is to accept, distribute, transport and deliver the mail. Two essential facilities for fulfilling these functions are customer lobby areas where customers conduct their retail transactions, access mail depositories and post office boxes and work room areas where postal employees distribute the mail and perform other core postal operations. Therefore, for purposes of the accessibility guidelines applicable to the Postal Service under the Architectural Barriers Act, two primary function areas are identified: Customer Lobbies and Workroom Areas.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Disproportionality.</I> (1) According to Section F202.6.2, “alteration” of elements in a primary function area can trigger a requirement to make accessibility improvements along the path of travel to the area and improvements to rest rooms, telephones, and drinking fountains that serve the altered area if the alteration “affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function.” It is conceivable that almost any repair or alteration project in a “primary function area” could affect the usability of the area. Therefore a literal interpretation of this provision could require an expansion of the scope of virtually any alteration in a primary function area, regardless of the size and scope of the original project. According to Section F202.6.2, accessibility improvements must be made to the path of travel to the altered area and to rest rooms, telephones, and drinking fountains that serve the altered area “unless such alterations are disproportionate to the overall alterations in terms of cost and scope”. 
</P>
<P>(2) For purposes of the accessibility guidelines applicable to the Postal Service under the Architectural Barriers Act, two criteria must be considered in making a determination whether accessibility improvements are disproportionate to the cost and scope of the original alteration: a magnitude threshold for the original alteration and a maximum “percentage threshold” for the accessibility alteration.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Magnitude threshold.</I> It is anticipated that, in most cases, a significant additional effort would be required to assess physical conditions along the path of travel and for rest rooms, telephones, and drinking fountains that serve the altered area, and to determine the scope, budget and appropriate design requirements for any corrective alterations. Unless the original alteration is of substantial magnitude, a disproportionate effort would be devoted to such investigation, design, and administration leaving few, if any funds to accomplish corrective work. Accordingly, a “magnitude threshold” is established such that no accessibility improvements to the path of travel, nor to any associated facilities, shall be required under F202.6.2 for alterations that have an estimated total cost less than 20 percent of the fair market value of the facility.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Percentage threshold.</I> For alterations subject to F202.6.2 that meet or exceed the “magnitude threshold,” the maximum cost for accessibility improvements to the path of travel, including all costs for accessibility improvements to rest rooms, telephones, and drinking fountains that serve the altered area, shall not exceed 20 percent of the total cost of the original alteration. Costs for accessibility improvements in excess of the 20 percent threshold shall be deemed “disproportionate.”

<P>(3) <I>Postmaster's Responsibility.</I> (i) A postmaster will receive notification from FHLBB when his office has been selected to conduct a Housing Vacancy Survey. Normally, written notification will be mailed to the postmaster 30 days in advance of the date FHLBB would like USPS to conduct the survey, since USPS is under no obligation to use overtime or auxiliary assistance to conduct these surveys. The postmaster or his designee will schedule the survey on or near the date requested and will promptly reply to FHLBB so that the necessary forms will be provided on time. 
</P>
<P>(ii) All necessary forms and instructions will be supplied directly to each post office to be surveyed. Postmasters will designate a manager in each delivery unit to coordinate the survey within the unit and to review completed survey forms for accuracy. 
</P>
<P>(iii) FHLBB may request USPS to perform special or emergency surveys with less than 30 days advance notice. Since FHLBB has agreed to reimburse USPS at twice the normal rates for promptly performing such surveys, every reasonable effort should be made to accommodate such requests in a timely manner. 
</P>
<P>(iv) Housing Vacancy Surveys will not be conducted during the month of December of any year. 
</P>
<P>(v) Postmasters will notify the Office of Delivery and Collection, Washington, DC 20260, of the number of each type survey form completed for FHLBB. FHLBB will then remit payment directly to Headquarters, USPS. 
</P>
<P>(vi) USPS will not release or publish any survey results except in response to a court order, subpoena, or as required by the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Unauthorized projects prohibited.</I> Do not conduct special surveys or otherwise participate in any cooperative projects without the authorization in paragraph (c) of this section.

</P>
<P>(1) The Red Cross will use Form 3575, Change of Address Order, as a standard item in Red Cross disaster relief. It will urge disaster victims displaced from their homes to obtain and complete the forms, it will distribute the forms to disaster victims who need them, and it will collect from the victims and turn over to the Postal Service any completed forms received. 
</P>
<P>(2) The Postal Service will provide the Red Cross the blank forms needed. 
</P>
<P>(3) During each disaster and subsequent disaster relief efforts, the Postal Service will establish a separate file of change of address forms completed by disaster victims, and will make available to the Red Cross information in the file.

<HEAD>§ 265.1   General provisions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Policy.</I> (1) This subpart contains the regulations that implement the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, insofar as the Act applies to the Postal Service. These rules should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Guidelines). The Postal Service FOIA Requester's Guide, an easy-to-read guide for making Postal Service FOIA requests, is available at <I>http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.</I>
</P>
<P>(2) Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed under part 266 of this chapter as well as under this subpart.
</P>
<P>(3) It is the policy of the Postal Service to make its official records available to the public to the maximum extent consistent with the public interest. This policy requires a practice of full disclosure of those records that are covered by the requirements of the FOIA, subject only to the specific exemptions required or authorized by law. The exemptions from mandatory disclosure for various types of records provided by 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and 39 U.S.C. 410(c) reflect the fact that under some circumstances, the public interest may be better served by leaving the disclosure of particular records to the discretion of the Postal Service rather than by requiring their disclosure. This Postal Service policy does not create any right enforceable in court.
</P>
<P>(4) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to entitle any person, as of right, to any service or to the disclosure of any record to which such person is not entitled under the FOIA.
</P>
<P>(b) Definitions—(1) <I>Record.</I> (i) For purposes of this part, a <I>record</I> is a discrete, distinct, or segregable grouping of information that pertains to a specific topic that is:
</P>
<P>(A) Recorded, regardless of media, format, or physical characteristics, including electronic data; and
</P>
<P>(B) In the custody or control of the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>(ii) The definition of a record does not include any discrete, distinct, or segregable grouping of information created at the discretion of an employee primarily for the employee's convenience and not disclosed to other employees. The definition of a record is not the same as a “document;” a single “document” may be a single record or it may include multiple records and groupings of information that do not constitute records as defined in this section.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Component.</I> For purposes of this subpart, <I>component</I> means any department or facility within the Postal Service that maintains records; the Office of Inspector General; and the Postal Inspection Service. Postal Service refers to all such components collectively.

<HEAD>§ 265.2   Proactive disclosure of Postal Service records.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>In general.</I> The Postal Service is responsible for determining which of its records must be made publicly available, for identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. The Postal Service's FOIA Requester Service Centers (RSCs) and FOIA Public Liaisons can assist individuals in locating Postal Service records. Descriptions of, and contact information for, the various FOIA RSCs can be found at <I>http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.</I>
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Records available in an electronic format.</I> Records that the FOIA requires the Postal Service to make available for public inspection in an electronic format pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) and that are exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), may be accessed through the Postal Service's Web site at <I>http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.</I> The Postal Service must ensure that its Web site of posted records and indices is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. Such records available for public inspection in an electronic format include the following:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Opinions.</I> All final opinions and orders made in the adjudication of cases by the Judicial Officer and Administrative Law Judges, all final determinations pursuant to section 404(b) of title 39, United States Code, to close or consolidate a post office, or to disapprove a proposed closing or consolidation, all advisory opinions concerning the private express statutes issued pursuant to 39 CFR 310.6, and all supplier disagreement decisions are on file and available for inspection and copying at the Headquarters Library and, if created on or after November 1, 1996, also at the Postal Service's Web site at <I>http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.</I>
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Administrative manuals and instructions.</I> The manuals, instructions, and other publications of the Postal Service that affect members of the public are available through the Headquarters Library and at many post offices and other postal facilities. Those which are available to the public but are not listed for sale may be inspected in the Headquarters Library, at any postal facility which maintains a copy, or, if created on or after November 1, 1996, through the Postal Service's Web site at <I>http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.</I> Copies of publications which are not listed as for sale or as available free of charge may be requested on an individual basis in accordance with the procedures provided in § 265.3.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Previously released records.</I> Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, that have been released to any person pursuant to the FOIA; and that because of the nature of their subject matter, the Postal Service determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records; or that have been requested 3 or more times, as well as a general index of such records. Records processed and disclosed after March 31, 1997, are available for inspection and copying at the Headquarters Library. Any such records created by the Postal Service on or after November 1, 1996, also will be available at the Postal Service's Web site identified at § 265.2(b). Records described in this paragraph that were not created by, or on behalf of, the Postal Service generally will not be available at the Web site. Records will be available in the form in which they were originally disclosed, except to the extent that they contain information that is not appropriate for public disclosure and may be withheld pursuant to this section. Any deleted material will be marked and the applicable exemptions indicated in accordance with § 265.6(d).
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Public index.</I> (i) A public index is maintained in the Headquarters Library and at the Web site of all final opinions and orders made by the Postal Service in the adjudication of cases, Postal Service policy statements which may be relied on as precedents in the disposition of cases, administrative staff manuals and instructions that affect the public, and other materials which the Postal Service elects to index and make available to the public on request in the manner set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) The index contains references to matters issued after July 4, 1967, and may reference matters issued prior to that date.
</P>
<P>(iii) Any person may arrange for the inspection of any matter in the public index in accordance with the procedures of § 265.3.
</P>
<P>(iv) Copies of the public index and of matters listed in the public index may be requested through the procedures described in § 265.3, with payment of any applicable fees.
</P>
<P>(v) Materials listed in the public index that were created on or after November 1, 1996, will also be available in electronic format at the Postal Service's Web site at <I>http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.</I>

<HEAD>§ 265.3   Procedure for submitting a FOIA request.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>To whom submitted.</I> A request must be submitted to the appropriate FOIA Requester Service Center (RSC). Descriptions of, and contact information for, the various FOIA RSCs can be found at <I>http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.</I> For assistance in determining the appropriate FOIA RSC, requesters may contact the USPS HQ FOIA Requester Service Center, Privacy and Records Office, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20260, telephone (202) 268-2608. Requests for listings of postal employee names should also be sent to the USPS HQ FOIA Requester Service Center.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Form of request.</I> A request to inspect or to obtain a copy of an identifiable Postal Service record must be in writing and bear the caption “Freedom of Information Act Request” or otherwise be clearly and prominently identified as a request for records pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, both on the letter and on the envelope or other cover. Requests for records that are labeled incorrectly may be delayed in reaching the appropriate FOIA RSC. A requester must provide his or her full name and mailing address. A requester may also provide a daytime telephone number or email address to facilitate communication regarding his or her request.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Content of request.</I> Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable Postal Service personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, requesters should include specific information about each record sought, such as the type of record (<I>e.g.,</I> contract, report, memorandum, etc.); the title or case number of a specific document or report; the topic or subject matter; the name of the office, facility, functional unit or employees most likely to possess the record; the geographical location, such as a city and state, where the records are thought to exist; the date or general timeframe of the record's creation; and any details related to the purpose of the record. Requests for email records should specify the likely senders and recipients, keywords, and a range of dates. If seeking information about a company, requesters should provide the exact name and address of the company (many companies use similar names). Before submitting requests, requesters may contact the relevant Postal Service FOIA Requester Service Center to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records. The request may state the maximum amount of fees for which the requester is willing to accept liability without prior notice. If no amount is stated, the requester will be deemed willing to accept liability for fees not to exceed $25.00. See paragraph (e)(2) of § 265.9.The request may also specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) of the requested records.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>First-party requests.</I> A requester who is making a request for records about himself must provide verification of identity sufficient to satisfy the component as to his identity prior to release of the record. For Privacy Act-protected records, the requester must further comply with the procedures set forth in 39 CFR 266.5.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Third-party requests.</I> Where a FOIA request seeks disclosure of records that pertain to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by submitting a written authorization signed by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (<I>e.g.,</I> a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, each component can require a requester to supply a notarized authorization, a declaration, a completed Privacy Waiver as set forth in 39 CFR 266.5(b)(2)(iii), or other additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Improper requests.</I> A request that does not reasonably describe the records sought, or does not comply with the published rules regarding the procedures to be followed for submitting a request, will be deemed to be an improper FOIA request. If after receiving a request, the Postal Service determines that it is improper, the Postal Service will inform the requester as to why the request is improper. If the requester fails to respond to the Postal Service's request for clarification or additional information within 30 calendar days, the Postal Service will assume the requester is no longer interested in pursuing the request and close its file. The FOIA Requester Service Centers and the FOIA Public Liaisons are available to assist requesters in correcting a request that does not reasonably describe the records sought.

<HEAD>§ 265.4   Responsibility for responding to requests.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>In general.</I> When a request is received, the FOIA RSC will either respond to the request, or refer the request to the appropriate FOIA RSC or records custodians. The FOIA RSC will advise the requester of any such referral. The Postal Service, the Office of Inspector General of the Postal Service, and the Postal Inspection Service, respectively, are responsible for responding to requests they receive for records they maintain. Records responsive to a request ordinarily will include only records in the Postal Service's possession as of the date of the search. If any other date is used, the Postal Service shall inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to the request.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Authority to grant or deny requests.</I> The records custodian of the requested record, or his designee, is authorized to grant or to deny the request. FOIA RSC staff may also grant or deny requests.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Receipt and tracking of requests.</I> FOIA RSCs are responsible for the initial receipt and tracking of FOIA requests.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Acknowledgments of requests.</I> FOIA RSCs must acknowledge the request in writing and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 working days to process. The acknowledgement of the request must include a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.

<DIV8 N="§ 265.5" NODE="39:1.0.1.4.34.1.1.5" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 265.5   Timing of responses to requests.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>In general.</I> Requests will ordinarily be responded to according to their order of receipt. A request that is not initially submitted to the appropriate FOIA RSC will be deemed to have been received by the Postal Service at the time that it is actually received by the appropriate FOIA RSC, but in any case a request will be deemed to have been received no later than 10 business days after the request is first received by a FOIA RSC.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Multitrack processing.</I> (1) Unless expedited processing has been granted, the Postal Service places each request in simple or complex tracks based on the amount of work and time involved in processing the request. Factors considered in assigning a request into the complex track may include one or more of the following factors:
</P>
<P>(i) The request involves voluminous documents;
</P>
<P>(ii) The complexity of the material;
</P>
<P>(iii) The request involves record searches at multiple facilities or locations;
</P>
<P>(iv) The request requires consultation among components or other agencies;
</P>
<P>(v) The number of open requests submitted by the same requester.
</P>
<P>(2) Within each track, the Postal Service processes requests in the order in which they are received. When appropriate, the FOIA RSC or the component will notify the requester if it has placed the request in the “Complex” track, and provide the requester with an opportunity to limit the scope of the request. If the requester limits the scope of the request, it may result in faster processing.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Expedited processing.</I> (1) Requests and appeals shall be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:
</P>
<P>(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;
</P>
<P>(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information.
</P>
<P>(2) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, a component may waive the formal certification requirement.
</P>
<P>(3) A component shall notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Unusual circumstances.</I> Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances”, as defined in the FOIA, and the component extends the time limit on that basis, the component shall, before the expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the component shall, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing and alert the requester to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services to provide dispute resolution services. The component shall make available its designated FOIA contact and its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Aggregating requests.</I> For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, the Postal Service may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a single requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. Multiple requests that involve unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.

<HEAD>§ 265.6   Responses to requests.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Grants of requests.</I> Once a component makes a determination to grant a request in whole or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing and include a statement alerting the requester of his or her right to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison. The component also shall inform the requester of any fees charged under § 265.9 and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Adverse determinations of requests.</I> A component making an adverse determination denying a request in any respect shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Content of denial.</I> The denial shall include, to the extent applicable:
</P>
<P>(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;
</P>
<P>(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the component in denying the request;
</P>
<P>(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and
</P>
<P>(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 265.8, and a description of the requirements set forth therein.
</P>
<P>(5) A statement notifying the requester of his or her right to seek dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison or the Office of Government Information Services.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Markings on released documents.</I> Markings on released documents must be clearly visible to the requester. Records disclosed in part shall be marked to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted shall also be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Use of record exclusions.</I> (1) In the event that a component identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), the component must confer with Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy (OIP), to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.
</P>
<P>(2) Any component invoking an exclusion must maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of exclusion by OIP.

<HEAD>§ 265.7   Confidential commercial information obtained from submitters.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Definitions.</I> (1) <I>Confidential commercial information</I> means commercial or financial information obtained by the Postal Service from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Submitter</I> means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides information, either directly or indirectly to the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Designation of confidential commercial information.</I> A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. The Postal Service will not determine the validity of any request for confidential treatment until a request for disclosure of the information is received. These designations shall expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>When notice to submitters is required.</I> (1) The Postal Service shall promptly provide written notice to a submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if, after reviewing the request, the responsive records, and any appeal by the requester, the Postal Service determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:
</P>
<P>(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or
</P>
<P>(ii) The Postal Service has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure under that exemption or any other applicable exemption.
</P>
<P>(2) The notice shall either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish it.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Exceptions to submitter notice requirements.</I> The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:
</P>
<P>(1) The Postal Service determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA or 39 U.S.C. 410(c);
</P>
<P>(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;
</P>
<P>(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a Postal Service regulation; if disclosure is required by a Postal Service regulation and the submitter provided written justification for protection of the information under Exemption 4 at the time of submission or a reasonable time thereafter, advanced written notice of the disclosure must be provided to the submitter; or
</P>
<P>(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous or overly broad, except that, in such cases, the component shall give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information and must provide that notice within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Opportunity to object to disclosure.</I> (1) The Postal Service shall specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced above. If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide the Postal Service a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Whenever possible, the submitter's claim of confidentiality should be supported by a statement or certification by an officer or authorized representative of the submitter that the information in question is in fact confidential, has not been disclosed to the public by the submitter, and is not routinely available to the public from other sources.
</P>
<P>(2) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information received by the Postal Service after the date of any disclosure decision shall not be considered by the Postal Service. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA. The Postal Service must consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Determination that confidential treatment is warranted.</I> If the Postal Service determines that confidential treatment is warranted for any part of the requested records and that the records will therefore be redacted or withheld, it must inform the requester in writing, and must advise the requester of the right to appeal. A copy of the letter of denial must also be provided to the submitter of the records in any case in which the submitter had been notified of the request.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Notice of intent to disclose.</I> If the Postal Service decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the Postal Service shall provide the submitter written notice, which shall include:
</P>
<P>(1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;
</P>
<P>(2) A description or copy of the information to be disclosed; and
</P>
<P>(3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.

<HEAD>§ 265.8   Administrative appeals.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Requirements for making an appeal.</I> Requesters may appeal adverse decisions rendered by the Postal Inspection Service or any Postal Service component by mail to the General Counsel, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20260; or by email to <I>foiaappeal@usps.gov.</I> The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days after the date of the response; or within a reasonable time if the appeal is from a failure of the custodian to act. The General Counsel may, in his or her discretion, consider late appeals. In the event of the denial of a request or of other action or failure to act on the part of a custodian from which no appeal is taken, the General Counsel may, if he or she considers that there is doubt as to the correctness of the custodian's action or failure to act, review the action or failure to act as though an appeal pursuant to this section had been taken. A letter of appeal should include, as applicable:
</P>
<P>(1) A copy of the request, of any notification of denial or other action, and of any other related correspondence;
</P>
<P>(2) The FOIA tracking number assigned to the request;
</P>
<P>(3) A statement of the action, or failure to act, from which the appeal is taken;
</P>
<P>(4) A statement identifying the specific redactions to responsive records that the requester is challenging;
</P>
<P>(5) A statement of the relief sought; and
</P>
<P>(6) A statement of the reasons why the requester believes the action or failure to act is erroneous.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Adjudication of appeals.</I> (1) The decision of the General Counsel or his or her designee constitutes the final decision of the Postal Service on the issue being appealed. The General Counsel will give prompt consideration to an appeal for expedited processing of a request. All other decisions normally will be made within 20 working days from the time of the receipt by the General Counsel. The 20-day response period may be extended by the General Counsel, or his or her designee, for a period not to exceed an additional 10 working days when reasonably necessary to permit the proper consideration of an appeal, under one or more of the unusual circumstances set forth in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. The aggregate number of additional working days utilized, however, may not exceed 10 working days.
</P>
<P>(2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.
</P>
<P>(3) On receipt of any appeal, the General Counsel, or his or her designee, must take appropriate action to ensure compliance with applicable classification rules.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Decisions on appeals.</I> A decision on an appeal must be made in writing. A decision that upholds a component's determination in whole or in part will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If a custodian's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the requester will be notified of that determination in writing. The component will further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and respond directly to the requester. If not prohibited by or under law, the General Counsel, or his designee may direct the disclosure of a record even though its disclosure is not required by law or regulation.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>When appeal is required.</I> Before seeking judicial review of a component's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Appeal procedures for the Office of the Inspector General.</I> The appeal procedures for the Office of the Inspector General are described in 39 CFR 230.5.

<DIV8 N="§ 265.9" NODE="39:1.0.1.4.34.1.1.9" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 265.9   Fees.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>In general.</I> The Postal Service shall charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, a component may contact a requester for additional information. The Postal Service will conduct searches, review, and duplication in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. The Postal Service ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to “U.S. Postal Service.”
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Definitions.</I> For purposes of this section:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Commercial-use requester</I> is a requester who asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The Postal Service's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Direct costs</I> are those expenses that the Postal Service incurs in searching for and duplicating records in order to respond to a FOIA request. In the case of commercial-use requesters, direct costs include reviewing and taking all other measures needed to prepare the records for disclosure.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Search</I> is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Duplication</I> is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Review</I> is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 265.6, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Educational institution</I> is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, an educational institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but rather are sought to further scholarly research. To fall within this fee category, the request must serve the scholarly research goals of the institution rather than an individual research goal.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Noncommercial scientific institution</I> is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use.
</P>
<P>(8) <I>Representative of the news media</I> is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term <I>news</I> means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the Internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, the Postal Service shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Charging fees.</I> In responding to FOIA requests, the Postal Service shall charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (j) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, components should not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Search.</I> (i) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. Search fees shall be charged for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The Postal Service may charge for time spent searching even if no responsive records are located or if it determines that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.
</P>
<P>(ii) For each half hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fee shall be $21.00.
</P>
<P>(iii) Requesters shall be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. Requesters shall be notified of the costs associated with creating such a program and must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.
</P>
<P>(iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), or other storage facility, additional costs may be charged for their retrieval.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Duplication.</I> Duplication fees shall be charged to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. A component shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by the component in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, the component shall provide one copy per request at a cost of fifteen cents per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, components shall charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, components shall charge the direct costs.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Review.</I> Commercial-use requesters shall be charged review fees at the rate of $21.00 for each half hour by personnel reviewing the records. Review fees shall be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record, <I>i.e.,</I> the review conducted by a component to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with a component's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Restrictions on charging fees.</I> (1) No search fees will be charged for requests by educational institutions (unless the records are sought for a commercial use), noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.
</P>
<P>(2)(i) If a component fails to comply with the time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees.
</P>
<P>(ii) If a component has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and the component provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, the component has an additional 10 days to respond to the request.
</P>
<P>(iii) If a component has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the component may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees if the following steps are taken:
</P>
<P>(A) The component provides timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester; and
</P>
<P>(B) The component discussed or made three good faith attempts to discuss via mail, email, or telephone how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii).
</P>
<P>(iv) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.
</P>
<P>(3) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.
</P>
<P>(4) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, components shall provide without charge:
</P>
<P>(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and
</P>
<P>(ii) The first two hours of search.
</P>
<P>(5) When, after first deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is $25.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00.</I> (1) When a component determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the component shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the component shall advise the requester accordingly. If the requester is a noncommercial use requester, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.
</P>
<P>(2) In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester agrees in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. Components are not required to accept payments in installments.
</P>
<P>(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the component estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the component shall toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The component shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.
</P>
<P>(4) Components shall make available their FOIA Public Liaison or other FOIA contact to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Charges for other services.</I> Although not required to provide special services, if a component chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service requested by the requester shall be charged. Examples of such services include providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Aggregating requests.</I> In instances where the Postal Service reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, or that a requester or group of requesters acting in concert makes multiple requests for the same records maintained at multiple facilities or components, the Postal Service may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. Multiple FOIA requests by a single requester related to the same issue will be aggregated for the purpose of assessing fees. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Advance payments.</I> (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (h)(2) or (3) of this section, a component shall not require the requester to submit an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (<I>i.e.,</I> payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.
</P>
<P>(2) When a component determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. A component may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.
</P>
<P>(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee within 30 calendar days of the billing date, a component may require that the requester pay the full amount due on that prior request, and the component may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the component begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where a component has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.
</P>
<P>(4) In cases in which a component requires advance payment, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of the component's fee determination, the request will be administratively closed.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Other statutes specifically providing for fees.</I> The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires the Postal Service to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the component shall inform the requester of the contact information for that program.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees.</I> (1) Records responsive to a request shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate below the rate established under paragraph (c) of this section, where a component determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated that:
</P>
<P>(i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Postal Service, and
</P>
<P>(ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
</P>
<P>(2) In deciding whether disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of operations or activities of the Postal Service, components shall consider all four of the following factors:
</P>
<P>(i) The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Postal Service, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.
</P>
<P>(ii) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not contribute to such understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.
</P>
<P>(iii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. A representative of the news media does not automatically satisfy this consideration.
</P>
<P>(iv) The public's understanding of the subject in question must be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent.
</P>
<P>(3) To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, components shall consider the following factors:
</P>
<P>(i) Whether there is a commercial interest, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. If so, then the requester will be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.
</P>
<P>(ii) Whether any identified commercial interest of the requester in disclosure outweighs the public interest, as defined in paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this section, in disclosure. If so, then the disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. The component ordinarily shall presume that if a news media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest is the primary interest served by the requested disclosure. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.
</P>
<P>(4) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those records.
</P>
<P>(5) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the component and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester shall be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.

If a subpoena or court order was issued, the responding official shall caution the moving party as to the possible dangers involved if the medical information is divulged.

</P>
<P>(i) Service of a demand for testimony or records (including, but not limited to, personnel or payroll information) relating to a current or former employee must be made in accordance with the applicable rules of civil procedure on the employee whose testimony is requested or the records custodian. The requester also shall deliver a copy of the demand to the District Manager, Customer Services and Sales, for all current employees whose work location is within the geographic boundaries of the manager's district, and any former employee whose last position was within the geographic boundaries of the manager's district. A demand for testimony or records must be received by the employee whose testimony is requested and the appropriate District Manager, Customer Services and Sales, at least ten (10) working days before the date the testimony or records are needed.
</P>
<P>(ii) Service of a demand for testimony or records other than those described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section must be made in accordance with the applicable rules of civil procedure on the employee whose testimony is requested or the records custodian. The requester also shall deliver a copy of the demand to the General Counsel, United States Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington DC 20260-1100, or the Chief Field Counsel. A demand for testimony or records must be received by the employee and the General Counsel or Chief Field Counsel at least ten (10) working days before the date testimony or records are needed.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Procedures followed in response to a demand for testimony or records.</I> (1) After an employee receives a demand for testimony or records, the employee shall immediately notify the General Counsel or Chief Field Counsel and request instructions.
</P>
<P>(2) An employee may not give testimony or produce records without the prior authorization of the General Counsel.
</P>
<P>(3)(i) The General Counsel may allow an employee to testify or produce records if the General Counsel determines that granting permission:
</P>
<P>(A) Would be appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the matter in which the demand arises and other applicable laws, privileges, rules, authority, and regulations; and
</P>
<P>(B) Would not be contrary to the interest of the United States. The interest of the United States includes, but is not limited to, furthering a public interest of the Postal Service and protecting the human and financial resources of the United States.
</P>
<P>(ii) An employee's testimony shall be limited to the information set forth in the statement described at paragraph (c)(2) of this section or to such portions thereof as the General Counsel determines are not subject to objection. An employee's testimony shall be limited to facts within the personal knowledge of the employee. A Postal Service employee authorized to give testimony under this rule is prohibited from giving expert or opinion testimony, answering hypothetical or speculative questions, or giving testimony with respect to privileged subject matter. The General Counsel may waive the prohibition of expert testimony under this paragraph only upon application and showing of exceptional circumstances and the request substantially meets the requirements of this section.
</P>
<P>(4) The General Counsel may establish conditions under which the employee may testify. If the General Counsel authorizes the testimony of an employee, the party seeking testimony shall make arrangements for the taking of testimony by those methods that, in the General Counsel's view, will least disrupt the employee's official duties. For example, at the General Counsel's discretion, testimony may be provided by affidavits, answers to interrogatories, written depositions, or depositions transcribed, recorded, or preserved by any other means allowable by law.
</P>
<P>(5) If a response to a demand for testimony or records is required before the General Counsel determines whether to allow an employee to testify, the employee or counsel for the employee shall do the following:
</P>
<P>(i) Inform the court or other authority of the regulations in this section; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Request that the demand be stayed pending the employee's receipt of the General Counsel's instructions.
</P>
<P>(6) If the court or other authority declines the request for a stay, or rules that the employee must comply with the demand regardless of the General Counsel's instructions, the employee or counsel for the employee shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand, citing <I>United States ex rel. Touhy</I> v. <I>Ragen,</I> 340 U.S. 462 (1951), and the regulations in this section.
</P>
<P>(7) The General Counsel may request the assistance of the Department of Justice or a U.S. Attorney where necessary to represent the interests of the Postal Service and the employee.
</P>
<P>(8) At his or her discretion, the General Counsel may grant a waiver of any procedure described by this section, where waiver is considered necessary to promote a significant interest of the United States or for other good cause.
</P>
<P>(9) If it otherwise is permissible, the records custodian may authenticate, upon the request of the party seeking disclosure, copies of the records. No employee of the Postal Service shall respond in strict compliance with the terms of a subpoena duces tecum unless specifically authorized by the General Counsel.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Postal Service employees as expert witnesses.</I> No Postal Service employee may testify as an expert or opinion witness, with regard to any matter arising out of the employee's official duties or the functions of the Postal Service, for any party other than the United States, except that in extraordinary circumstances, the General Counsel may approve such expert testimony in private litigation. A Postal Service employee may not testify as such an expert witness without the express authorization of the General Counsel. A litigant must obtain authorization of the General Counsel before designating a Postal Service employee as an expert witness.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Substitution of Postal Service employees.</I> Although a demand for testimony may be directed to a named Postal Service employee, the General Counsel, where appropriate, may designate another Postal Service employee to give testimony. Upon request and for good cause shown (for example, when a particular Postal Service employee has direct knowledge of a material fact not known to the substitute employee designated by the Postal Service), the General Counsel may permit testimony by a named Postal Service employee.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Fees and costs.</I> (1) The Postal Service may charge fees, not to exceed actual costs, to private litigants seeking testimony or records by request or demand. The fees, which are to be calculated to reimburse fully the Postal Service for processing the demand and providing the witness or records, may include, among others:
</P>
<P>(i) Costs of time spent by employees, including attorneys, of the Postal Service to process and respond to the demand;
</P>
<P>(ii) Costs of attendance of the employee and agency attorney at any deposition, hearing, or trial;
</P>
<P>(iii) Travel costs of the employee and agency attorney;
</P>
<P>(iv) Costs of materials and equipment used to search for, process, and make available information.
</P>
<P>(2) All costs for employee time shall be calculated on the hourly pay of the employee (including all pay, allowance, and benefits) and shall include the hourly fee for each hour, or portion of each hour, when the employee is in travel, in attendance at a deposition, hearing, or trial, or is processing or responding to a request or demand.
</P>
<P>(3) At the discretion of the Postal Service, where appropriate, costs may be estimated and collected before testimony is given.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Acceptance of service.</I> This section does not in any way abrogate or modify the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. Appendix) regarding service of process.

Authorization will be provided by:
</P>
<P>(i) The Postal Inspector in Charge of the affected field Division, or designee, for Division personnel and records, after that official has determined through consultation with Inspection Service legal counsel that no legal objection, privilege, or exemption applies to such testimony or production of documents.
</P>
<P>(ii) The Chief Postal Inspector or designee for Headquarters employees and records, after that official has determined through consultation with Inspection Service legal counsel, that no legal objection, privilege, or exemption applies to such testimony or production of documents.
</P>
<P>(2) Consideration shall be given to:
</P>
<P>(i) Statutory restrictions, as well as any legal objection, exemption, or privilege that may apply;
</P>
<P>(ii) Relevant legal standards for disclosure of nonpublic information and documents;

<P>(iii) Inspection Service rules and regulations and the public interest;
</P>
<P>(iv) Conservation of employee time; and
</P>
<P>(v) Prevention of the expenditure of Postal Service resources for private purposes.
</P>
<P>(3) If additional information is necessary before a determination can be made, the authorizing official may, in coordination with Inspection Service legal counsel, request assistance from the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Compliance with subpoena duces tecum.</I> (1) Except as required by part 262 of this chapter, produce any other record of the Postal Service only in compliance with a subpoena <I>duces tecum</I> or appropriate court order.
</P>
<P>(2) Do not release any record containing information relating to an employee's security or loyalty.
</P>
<P>(3) Honor subpoenas and court orders only when disclosure is authorized.
</P>
<P>(4) When authorized to comply with a subpoena <I>duces tecum</I> or court order, do not leave the originals with the court.
</P>
<P>(5) Postal Inspector reports are considered to be confidential internal documents and shall not be released unless there is specific authorization by the Chief Postal Inspector or the Inspector in Charge of the affected field Division, after consulting with Inspection Service legal counsel.
</P>
<P>(6) The Inspection Service Manual and other operating instructions issued to Inspection Service employees are considered to be confidential and shall not be released unless there is specific authorization, after consultation with Inspection Service legal counsel. If the requested information relates to confidential investigative techniques, or release of the information would adversely affect the law enforcement mission of the Inspection Service, the subpoenaed official, through Inspection Service legal counsel, may request an <I>in camera, ex parte</I> conference to determine the necessity for the release of the information. The entire Manual should not be given to any party.
</P>
<P>(7) Notes, memoranda, reports, transcriptions, whether written or recorded and made pursuant to an official investigation conducted by a member of the Inspection Service, are the property of the Inspection Service and are part of the official case file, whether stored with the official file.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Compliance with summonses and subpoenas ad testificandum.</I> (1) If an Inspection Service employee is served with a third-party summons or a subpoena requiring an appearance in court, contact should be made with Inspection Service legal counsel to determine whether and which exemptions or restrictions apply to proposed testimony. Inspection Service employees are directed to comply with summonses, subpoenas, and court orders, as to appearance, but may not testify without authorization.
</P>
<P>(2) Postal Inspector reports or records will not be presented during testimony, in either state or federal courts in which the United States, the Postal Service, or another federal agency is not a party in interest, unless authorized by the Chief Postal Inspector or the Postal Inspector in Charge of the affected field Division, who will make the decision after consulting with Inspection Service legal counsel. If an attempt is made to compel production, through testimony, the employee is directed to decline to produce the information or matter and to state that it may be exempted and may not be disclosed or produced without the specific approval of the Chief Postal Inspector or the Postal Inspector in Charge of the affected field Division. The Postal Service will offer all possible assistance to the courts, but the question of disclosing information for which an exemption may be claimed is a matter of discretion that rests with the appropriate official. Paragraph (e) of this section covers the release of Inspection Service documents in cases where the Postal Service or the United States is not a party.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>General procedures for obtaining Inspection Service documents and testimony from Inspection Service employees.</I> (1) To facilitate the orderly response to demands for the testimony of Inspection Service employees and production of documents in cases where the United States, the Postal Service, or another federal agency is not a party, all demands for the production of nonpublic documents or testimony of Inspection Service employees concerning matters relating to their official duties and not subject to the exemptions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section shall be in writing and conform to the requirements outlined in paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) Before or simultaneously with service of a demand described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the requesting party shall serve on the Counsel, Office of the Chief Postal Inspector, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20260-2101, an affidavit or declaration containing the following information:
</P>
<P>(i) The title of the case and the forum where it will be heard;
</P>
<P>(ii) The party's interest in the case;
</P>
<P>(iii) The reasons for the demand;
</P>
<P>(iv) A showing that the requested information is available, by law, to a party outside the Postal Service;
</P>
<P>(v) If testimony is sought, a summary of the anticipated testimony;
</P>
<P>(vi) If testimony is sought, a showing that Inspection Service records could not be provided and used in place of the requested testimony;
</P>
<P>(vii) The intended use of the documents or testimony; and
</P>
<P>(viii) An affirmative statement that the documents or testimony is necessary for defending or prosecuting the case at issue.
</P>
<P>(3) The Counsel, Office of the Chief Postal Inspector, shall act as agent for the receipt of legal process for demands for production of records or testimony of Inspection Service employees where the United States, the Postal Service, or any other federal agency is not a party. A subpoena for testimony or for the production of documents from an Inspection Service employee concerning official matters shall be served in accordance with the applicable rules of civil procedure. A copy of the subpoena and affidavit or declaration, if not previously furnished, shall also be sent to the Chief Postal Inspector or the appropriate Postal Inspector in Charge.
</P>
<P>(4) Any Inspection Service employee who is served with a demand shall promptly inform the Chief Postal Inspector, or the appropriate Postal Inspector in Charge, of the nature of the documents or testimony sought and all relevant facts and circumstances.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Authorization of testimony or production of documents.</I> (1) The Chief Postal Inspector or the Postal Inspector in Charge of the affected field Division, after consulting with Inspection Service legal counsel, shall determine whether testimony or the production of documents will be authorized.
</P>
<P>(2) Before authorizing the requested testimony or the production of documents, the Chief Postal Inspector or the Postal Inspector in Charge of the affected field Division shall consider the following factors:
</P>
<P>(i) Statutory restrictions, as well as any legal objection, exemption, or privilege that may apply;
</P>
<P>(ii) Relevant legal standards for disclosure of nonpublic information and documents;
</P>
<P>(iii) Inspection Service rules and regulations and the public interest;
</P>
<P>(iv) Conservation of employee time; and
</P>
<P>(v) Prevention of expenditures of government time and resources solely for private purposes.
</P>
<P>(3) If, in the opinion of the authorizing official, the documents should not be released or testimony should not be furnished, that official's decision is final.
</P>
<P>(4) Inspection Service legal counsel may consult or negotiate with the party or the party's counsel seeking testimony or documents to refine and limit the demand, so that compliance is less burdensome, or obtain information necessary to make the determination whether the documents or testimony will be authorized. If the party or party's counsel seeking the documents or testimony fails to cooperate in good faith, preventing Inspection Service legal counsel from making an informed recommendation to the authorizing official, that failure may be presented to the court or other body conducting the proceeding as a basis for objection.
</P>
<P>(5) Permission to testify or to release documents in all cases will be limited to matters outlined in the affidavit or declaration described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section or to such parts as deemed appropriate by the authorizing official.
</P>
<P>(6) If the authorizing official allows the release of documents or testimony to be given by an employee, arrangements shall be made for the taking of testimony or receipt of documents by the least disruptive methods to the employee's official duties. Testimony may, for example, be provided by affidavits, answers to interrogatories, written depositions, or depositions transcribed, recorded, or preserved by any other means allowable by law.
</P>
<P>(i) While giving a deposition, the employee may, at the option of the authorizing official, be represented by Inspection Service legal counsel.
</P>
<P>(ii) While completing affidavits, or other written reports or at any time during the process of preparing for testimony or releasing documents, the employee may seek the assistance of Inspection Service legal counsel.
</P>
<P>(7) Absent written authorization from the authorizing official, the employee shall respectfully decline to produce the requested documents, testify, or, otherwise, disclose the requested information.
</P>
<P>(8) If the authorization is denied or not received by the return date, the employee, together with counsel, where appropriate, shall appear at the stated time and place, produce a copy of this section, and respectfully decline to testify or produce any document on the basis of the regulations in this section.
</P>
<P>(9) The employee shall appear as ordered by the subpoena, summons, or other appropriate court order, unless:
</P>
<P>(i) Legal counsel has advised the employee that an appearance is inappropriate, as in cases where the subpoena, summons, or other court order was not properly issued or served, has been withdrawn, discovery has been stayed; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Where the Postal Service will present a legal objection to furnishing the requested information or testimony.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Inspection Service employees as expert or opinion witnesses.</I> No Inspection Service employee may testify as an expert or opinion witness, with regard to any matter arising out of the employee's duties or functions at the Postal Service, for any party other than the United States, except that in extraordinary circumstances, the Counsel, Office of the Chief Postal Inspector, may approve such testimony in private litigation. An Inspection Service employee may not testify as such an expert or opinion witness without the express authorization of the Counsel, Office of the Chief Postal Inspector. A litigant must first obtain authorization of the Counsel, Office of the Chief Postal Inspector, before designating an Inspection Service employee as an expert or opinion witness.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Postal liability.</I> This section is intended to provide instructions to Inspection Service employees and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party against the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>(k) <I>Fees.</I> (1) Unless determined by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable statute, the costs of providing testimony, including transcripts, shall be borne by the requesting party.
</P>
<P>(2) Unless limited by statute, such costs shall also include reimbursement to the Postal Service for the usual and ordinary expenses attendant upon the employee's absence from his or her official duties in connection with the case or matter, including the employee's salary and applicable overhead charges, and any necessary travel expenses as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) The Inspection Service is authorized to charge reasonable fees to parties demanding documents or information. Such fees, calculated to reimburse the Postal Service for the cost of responding to a demand, may include the costs of time expended by Inspection Service employees, including attorneys, to process and respond to the demand; attorney time for reviewing the demand and for legal work in connection with the demand; expenses generated by equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the requested information; travel costs of the employee and the agency attorney, including lodging and per diem where appropriate. Such fees shall be assessed at the rates and in the manner specified in § 265.9.
</P>
<P>(ii) At the discretion of the Inspection Service where appropriate, fees and costs may be estimated and collected before testimony is given.
</P>
<P>(iii) The provisions in this section do not affect rights and procedures governing public access to official documents pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C 552.
</P>
<P>(l) <I>Acceptance of service.</I> The rules in this section in no way modify the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. Appendix) regarding service of process.

<DIV8 N="§ 265.14" NODE="39:1.0.1.4.34.3.1.1" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 265.14   Rules concerning specific categories of records.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Records available to the public on request.</I> Except as otherwise proscribed by law or regulations, including but not limited to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, § 265.2 and § 265.11-§ 265.13, Postal Service records will be made available to any person in accordance with the procedures provided in § 265.3.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Information not subject to mandatory public disclosure.</I> Certain types of information are exempt from mandatory disclosure under exemptions contained in the Freedom of Information Act and in 39 U.S.C. 410(c). The Postal Service will exercise its discretion, in accordance with the policy stated in § 265.1(c), as implemented by instructions issued by the Records Office with the approval of the General Counsel in determining whether the public interest is served by the inspection or copying of records that are:
</P>
<P>(1) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>(2) Trade secrets, or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information, obtained from any person.
</P>
<P>(3) Information of a commercial nature, including trade secrets, whether or not obtained from a person outside the Postal Service, which under good business practice would not be publicly disclosed. Information is of a commercial nature if it relates to commerce, trade, profit, or the Postal Service's ability to conduct itself in a businesslike manner.
</P>
<P>(i) When assessing whether information is commercial in nature, the Postal Service will consider whether the information:
</P>
<P>(A) Relates to products or services subject to economic competition, including, but not limited to, “competitive” products or services as defined in 39 U.S.C. 3631, an inbound international service, or an outbound international service for which rates or service features are treated as nonpublic;
</P>
<P>(B) Relates to the Postal Service's activities that are analogous to a private business in the marketplace;
</P>
<P>(C) Would be of potential benefit to individuals or entities in economic competition with the Postal Service, its customers, suppliers, affiliates, or business partners or could be used to cause harm to a commercial interest of the Postal Service, its customers, suppliers, affiliates, or business partners;
</P>
<P>(D) Is proprietary or includes conditions or protections on distribution and disclosure, is subject to a nondisclosure agreement, or a third party has otherwise expressed an interest in protecting such information from disclosure;
</P>
<P>(E) Is the result of negotiations, agreements, contracts or business deals between the Postal Service and a business entity; or
</P>
<P>(F) Relates primarily to the Postal Service's governmental functions or its activities as a provider of basic public services.
</P>
<P>(ii) No one factor is determinative. Rather, each factor should be considered in conjunction with the other factors and the overall character of the particular information. Some examples of commercial information include, but are not limited to:
</P>
<P>(A) Information related to methods of handling valuable registered mail.
</P>
<P>(B) Records of money orders except as provided in section 509.3 of the Domestic Mail Manual.
</P>
<P>(C) Technical information concerning postage meters and prototypes submitted for Postal Service approval prior to leasing to mailers.
</P>
<P>(D) Quantitative data, whether historical or current, reflecting the number of postage meters or PC postage accounts.
</P>
<P>(E) Reports of market surveys conducted by or under contract on behalf of the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>(F) Records indicating carrier or delivery lines of travel.
</P>
<P>(G) Information which, if publicly disclosed, could materially increase procurement costs.
</P>
<P>(H) Information which, if publicly disclosed, could compromise testing or examination materials.
</P>
<P>(I) Service performance data on competitive services.
</P>
<P>(J) Facility specific volume, revenue, and cost information.
</P>
<P>(K) Country-specific international mail volume and revenue data.
</P>
<P>(L) Non-public international volume, revenue and cost data.
</P>
<P>(M) Pricing and negotiated terms in bilateral arrangements with foreign postal operators.
</P>
<P>(N) Information identifying USPS business customers.
</P>
<P>(O) Financial information in or the identities of parties to Negotiated Service Agreements or Package Incentive Agreements.
</P>
<P>(P) Negotiated terms in contracts.
</P>
<P>(Q) Negotiated terms in leases.
</P>
<P>(R) Geolocation data.
</P>
<P>(S) Proprietary algorithms or software created by the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>(T) Sales performance goals, standards, or requirements.
</P>
<P>(U) Technical information or specifications concerning mail processing equipment.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes.</I> (1) Investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes, whether or not considered closed, are exempt by statute from mandatory disclosure except to the extent otherwise available by law to a party other than the Postal Service, 39 U.S.C. 410(c)(6). As a matter of policy, however, the Postal Service will normally make records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes available upon request unless the production of these records:
</P>
<P>(i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;
</P>
<P>(ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;
</P>
<P>(iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
</P>
<P>(iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority (such as the Postal Inspection Service) in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;
</P>
<P>(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
</P>
<P>(vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.
</P>
<P>(2) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records that could reasonably be expected to interfere with law enforcement proceedings, and
</P>
<P>(i) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law; and
</P>
<P>(ii) There is reason to believe that,
</P>
<P>(A) The subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency, and
</P>

Postal Service records will normally be available for inspection and copying during regular business hours at the postal facilities at which they are maintained. The custodian may, however, designate other reasonable locations and times for inspection and copying of some or all of the records that are in the custodian's possession. If the requested record has been identified and a copy is to be provided to the requester, the copy must be promptly provided.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Identification of requester.</I> The requester must present identification sufficient to satisfy the custodian as to the requester's identity prior to record review or other access. As appropriate under the circumstances of the access request, the requester may be required to comply with one of the following identification verification methods:
</P>
<P>(i) Provision of a completed <I>Certification of Identity</I> if the records pertain to the requester available at <I>http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm;</I>
</P>
<P>(ii) Provision of official photo identification if the records pertain to the requester, examples of which are a valid driver's license, unexpired passport, and unexpired federal government-issued employee identification card; or
</P>
<P>(iii) Provision of a completed <I>Privacy Waiver</I> if the records pertain to another individual available at <I>http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm</I>.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Responsibilities of requester.</I> The requester assumes the following responsibilities regarding the review of official personal records:
</P>
<P>(i) The requester must agree not to leave Postal Service premises with official records unless specifically given a copy for that purpose by the custodian or the custodian's representative.
</P>
<P>(ii) At the conclusion of the inspection, the requester must sign a statement indicating the requester has reviewed specific records or categories of records. If the requester indicates at the beginning of the inspection that he or she will not sign the statement, records may still be reviewed, and the time and date of review will be noted in the file.
</P>
<P>(iii) The requester may be accompanied by a person of the requester's choice to aid in the inspection of information and, if applicable, the manual recording or copying of the records if the requester submits a signed statement authorizing the person to do so, and discussion of the records in the accompanying person's presence.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Special restrictions for medical and psychological records.</I> A medical or psychological record must be disclosed to the requester to whom it pertains unless, in the judgment of the medical officer, access to such record could have an adverse effect upon such individual. When the medical officer determines that the disclosure of medical information could have an adverse effect upon the individual to whom it pertains, the medical officer will transmit such information to a medical doctor named by the requesting individual. In such cases, an accounting of the disclosure must be kept.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Limitations on access.</I> Nothing in this section shall allow an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding. Other limitations on access are specifically addressed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section and § 266.8.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Response when compliance is not possible.</I> A reply denying a written request to review or otherwise access a record must be in writing, signed by the custodian or other appropriate official and must be made only if such a record does not exist or does not contain personal information relating to the requester, or is exempt from disclosure. This reply must include a statement regarding the determining factors of denial, and the right to appeal the denial to the General Counsel.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Compliance with notification request.</I> The custodian must promptly notify a requester if a record has been located in response to a request for notification as to whether a specific system of records contains a record pertaining to the requester, unless exempt from notification.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Compliance with request for amendment.</I> The custodian must:
</P>
<P>(1) Correct or eliminate any information that is found to be incomplete, inaccurate, not relevant to a statutory purpose of the Postal Service, or not timely, and notify the requester when this action is complete; or
</P>
<P>(2) Not later than 30 working days after receipt of a request to amend, notify the requester of a determination not to amend, the reason for the refusal, and of the requester's right to appeal, or to submit, in lieu of an appeal, a statement of reasonable length setting forth a position regarding the disputed information to be attached to the contested personal record.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Availability of assistance in exercising rights.</I> The Privacy and Records Management Office is available to provide an individual with assistance in exercising rights pursuant to this part.

<HEAD>§ 266.6   Appeal procedure.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Appeal procedure.</I> (1) If a request for notification of or to inspect, copy, or amend a record is denied, in whole or in part, or if no determination is made within the period prescribed by this part, the requester may appeal to the General Counsel, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20260-1101.
</P>
<P>(2) The requester must submit an appeal in writing within 90 days of the date of denial, or within 90 days of such request if the appeal is from a failure of the custodian to make a determination. The letter of appeal should include, as applicable:

The decision on the appeal must be in writing and, in the event of a denial, must set forth the reasons for such denial and state the individual's right to obtain judicial review in a district court. An indexed file of decisions on appeals must be maintained by the General Counsel.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Submission of statement of disagreement.</I> If the final decision concerning a request for the amendment of a record does not satisfy the requester, any statement of reasonable length provided by that individual setting forth a position regarding the disputed information will be accepted and attached to the relevant personal record.

<P>(a) <I>Policy.</I> The purpose of this section is to establish fair and equitable fees to permit duplication of records for subject individuals (or authorized representatives) while recovering the full allowable direct costs incurred by the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Duplication.</I> (1) For duplicating any paper or micrographic record or publication or computer report, the fee is $.15 per page, except that the first 100 pages furnished in response to a particular request must be furnished without charge. See paragraph (c) of this section for fee limitations.
</P>
<P>(2) The Postal Service may at its discretion make user-paid copy machines available at any location. In that event, requesters will be given the opportunity to make copies at their own expense.
</P>
<P>(3) The Postal Service normally will not furnish more than one copy of any record. If duplicate copies are furnished at the request of the requester; a fee of $0.15 per page is charged for each copy of each duplicate page without regard to whether the requester is eligible for free copies pursuant to § 266.7(b)(1).
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Limitations.</I> No fee will be charged to an individual for the process of retrieving, reviewing, or amending a record pertaining to that individual.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Reimbursement.</I> The Postal Service may, at its discretion, require reimbursement of its costs as a condition of participation in a computer matching program or activity with another agency. The agency to be charged is notified in writing of the approximate costs before they are incurred. Costs are calculated in accordance with the schedule of fees set forth at § 265.9.

<DIV8 N="§ 266.8" NODE="39:1.0.1.4.35.0.1.8" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 266.8   Exemptions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U.S.C. 410(c), provides that certain categories of information are exempt from disclosure under the Privacy Act. In addition, the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and (k), authorizes the Postmaster General to exempt systems of records meeting certain criteria from various other subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a. With respect to systems of records so exempted, nothing in this part shall require compliance with provisions hereof implementing any subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a from which those systems have been exempted.
</P>
<P>(b) Paragraph (b)(1) of this section summarizes the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a for which exemption is claimed for some systems of records pursuant to, and to the extent permitted by, 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and (k). Paragraphs (b)(2) through (5) of this section identify the exempted systems of records, the exemptions applied to each, and the reasons for the exemptions:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Explanation of provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a for which an exemption is claimed in the systems discussed in this section.</I> (i) Subsection (c)(3) of 5 U.S.C. 552a requires an agency to make available to the individual named in the records an accounting of each disclosure of records at the individual's request.
</P>
<P>(ii) Subsection (c)(4) requires an agency to inform any person or other agency to which a record has been disclosed of any correction or notation of dispute the agency has made to the record in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(d).
</P>
<P>(iii) Subsections (d)(1) through (4) require an agency to permit an individual to gain access to records about the individual, to request amendment of such records, to request a review of an agency decision not to amend such records, and to provide a statement of disagreement about a disputed record to be filed and disclosed with the disputed record.
</P>
<P>(iv) Subsection (e)(1) requires an agency to maintain in its records only such information about an individual that is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose required by statute or executive order of the President.
</P>
<P>(v) Subsection (e)(2) requires an agency to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs.
</P>
<P>(vi) Subsection (e)(3) requires an agency to inform each person whom it asks to supply information of the authority under which the information is sought, the purposes for which the information will be used, the routine uses that may be made of the information, whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, and the effects of not providing the information.
</P>
<P>(vii) Subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) requires an agency to publish a <E T="04">Federal Register</E> notice of its procedures whereby an individual can be notified upon request whether the system of records contains information about the individual, how to gain access to any record about the individual contained in the system, and how to contest its content.
</P>
<P>(viii) Subsection (e)(5) requires an agency to maintain its records with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to ensure fairness to the individual in making any determination about the individual.
</P>
<P>(ix) Subsection (e)(8) requires an agency to make reasonable efforts to serve notice on an individual when any record on such individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal process when such process becomes a matter of public record.
</P>
<P>(x) Subsection (f) requires an agency to establish procedures whereby an individual can be notified upon request if any system of records named by the individual contains a record pertaining to the individual, obtain access to the record, and request amendment.
</P>
<P>(xi) Subsection (g) provides for civil remedies if an agency fails to comply with the access and amendment provisions of subsections (d)(1) and (3), and with other provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a, or any rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual.
</P>
<P>(xii) Subsection (m) requires an agency to apply the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a to a contractor operating a system of records to accomplish an agency function.
</P>
<P>(2) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), Postal Service record systems; <I>Inspection Service Investigative File System, USPS 700.000; Mail Cover Program Records, USPS 700.100; Inspector General Investigative Records, USPS 700.300</I> are exempt from subsections 552a (c)(3), (c)(4), (d)(1)-(4), (e)(1)-(3), (e)(4)(G) and (H), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), (g), and (m) because the systems contain information pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. The reasons for exemption follow:
</P>
<P>(i) Disclosure to the record subject pursuant to subsections (c)(3), (c)(4), or (d)(1)-(4) could:
</P>
<P>(A) Alert subjects that they are targets of an investigation or mail cover by the Postal Inspection Service or an investigation by the Office of Inspector General;
</P>
<P>(B) Alert subjects of the nature and scope of the investigation and of evidence obtained;
</P>
<P>(C) Enable the subject of an investigation to avoid detection or apprehension;
</P>
<P>(D) Subject confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel to harassment or intimidation if their identities were released to the target of an investigation;
</P>
<P>(E) Constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy of third parties who are involved in a certain investigation;
</P>
<P>(F) Intimidate potential witnesses and make them reluctant to offer information;
</P>
<P>(G) Lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction or alteration of evidence yet to be discovered, the fabrication of testimony, or the compromising of classified material; or
</P>
<P>(H) Seriously impede or compromise law enforcement, mail cover, or background investigations that might involve law enforcement aspects as a result of the above.
</P>
<P>(ii) Application of subsections (e)(1) and (5) is impractical because the relevance, necessity, or correctness of specific information might be established only after considerable analysis and as the investigation progresses. As to relevance (subsection (e)(1)), effective law enforcement requires the keeping of information not relevant to a specific Postal Inspection Service investigation or Office of Inspector General investigation. Such information may be kept to provide leads for appropriate law enforcement and to establish patterns of activity that might relate to the jurisdiction of the Office of Inspector General, Postal Inspection Service, and other agencies. As to accuracy (subsection (e)(5)), the correctness of records sometimes can be established only in a court of law.
</P>
<P>(iii) Application of subsections (e)(2) and (3) would require collection of information directly from the subject of a potential or ongoing investigation. The subject would be put on alert that he or she is a target of an investigation by the Office of Inspector General, or an investigation or mail cover by the Postal Inspection Service, enabling avoidance of detection or apprehension, thereby seriously compromising law enforcement, mail cover, or background investigations involving law enforcement aspects. Moreover, in certain circumstances the subject of an investigation is not required to provide information to investigators, and information must be collected from other sources.
</P>
<P>(iv) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do not apply because these systems are exempt from the provisions of subsection (d). Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of its notification, access, and contest procedures because access is appropriate in some cases.
</P>
<P>(v) Application of subsection (e)(8) could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subject of the investigation.
</P>
<P>(vi) The provisions of subsection (g) do not apply because exemption from the provisions of subsection (d) renders the provisions on suits to enforce subsection (d) inapplicable.
</P>
<P>(vii) If one of these systems of records is operated in whole or in part by a contractor, the exemptions claimed herein will remain applicable to it (subsection (m)).
</P>
<P>(3) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), Postal Service record systems <I>Labor Relations Records, USPS 200.000; Employee Inquiry, Complaint and Investigative Records, USPS 100.900; Inspection Service Investigative File System, USPS 700.000; Mail Cover Program Records, USPS 700.100; Inspector General Investigative Records, USPS 700.300;</I> and <I>Financial Transactions, USPS 860.000,</I> are exempt from certain subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a because the systems contain investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes other than material within the scope of subsection 552a(j)(2).
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Inspection Service Investigative File System, USPS 700.000; Mail Cover Program Records, USPS 700.100;</I> and <I>Inspector General Investigative Records, USPS 700.300,</I> are exempt from subsections 552a(c)(3), (d)(1)-(4), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G) and (H), and (f) for the same reasons as stated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Labor Relations Records, USPS 200.000,</I> is exempt from subsections 552a(d)(1)-(4), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) for the following reasons:
</P>
<P>(A) Application of the requirements at subsections (d)(1)-(4) would cause disruption of the enforcement of the laws relating to equal employment opportunity (EEO). It is essential to the integrity of the EEO complaint system that information collected in the investigative process not be prematurely disclosed.
</P>
<P>(B) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do not apply for the same reasons described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.
</P>
<P>(iii) <I>Financial Transactions, USPS 860.000,</I> is exempt from subsections 552a(c)(3), (d)(1)-(4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) for the following reasons:
</P>
<P>(A) Disclosure of the record subject pursuant to subsections (c)(3) and (d)(1)-(4) would violate the non-notification provision of the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(2), under which the Postal Service is prohibited from notifying a transaction participant that a suspicious transaction report has been made. In addition, the access provisions of subsections (c)(3) and (d)(1)-(4) would alert individuals that they have been identified as suspects or possible subjects of investigation and thus seriously hinder the law enforcement purposes underlying the suspicious transaction reports.
</P>
<P>(B) This system is in compliance with subsection (e)(1) because maintenance of the records is required by law. Strict application of the relevance and necessity requirements of subsection (e)(1) to suspicious transactions would be impractical, however, because the relevance or necessity of specific information can often be established only after considerable analysis and as an investigation progresses.
</P>
<P>(C) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) and (f) do not apply because this system is exempt from the provisions of subsection (d). Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of its notification, access, and contest procedures because access is appropriate in some cases.
</P>
<P>(4) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), Postal Service record systems <I>Recruiting, Examining, and Placement Records, USPS 100.100; Inspection Service Investigative File System, USPS 700.000; and Inspector General Investigative Records, USPS 700.300</I> are exempt from certain subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a because the systems contain investigatory material compiled for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for employment, contracts, or access to classified information.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Recruiting, Examining, and Placement Records, USPS 100.100,</I> is exempt from subsections 552a(d)(1)(4) and (e)(1) for the following reasons:
</P>
<P>(A) During its investigation and evaluation of an applicant for a position, the Postal Service contacts individuals who, without an assurance of anonymity, would refuse to provide information concerning the subject of the investigation. If a record subject were given access pursuant to subsection (d)(1)-(4), the promised confidentiality would be breached and the confidential source would be identified. The result would be restriction of the free flow of information vital to a determination of an individual's qualifications and suitability for appointment to or continued occupancy of his or her position.
</P>
<P>(B) In collecting information for investigative and evaluative purposes, it is impossible to determine in advance what information might be of assistance in determining the qualifications and suitability of an individual for appointment. Information that seems irrelevant, when linked with other information, can sometimes provide a composite picture of an individual that assists in determining whether that individual should be appointed to or retained in a position. For this reason, exemption from subsection (e)(1) is claimed.
</P>
<P>(C) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do not apply because this system is exempt from the provisions of subsection (d). Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of its notification, access, and contest procedures because access is appropriate in some cases.
</P>
<P>(ii) <I>Inspection Service Investigative File System, USPS 700.000; and Inspector General Investigative Records, USPS 700.300,</I> are exempt from subsections 552a(c)(3), (d)(1)-(4), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G) and (H), and (f) for the same reasons as stated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
</P>
<P>(5) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6), Postal Service record systems <I>Employee Development and Training Records, USPS 100.300; Personnel Research Records, 100.600; and Emergency Management Records, USPS 500.300</I> are exempt from subsections 552a(d)(1)-(4), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) because the systems contain testing or examination material the disclosure of which would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the material. The reasons for exemption follow:
</P>
<P>(i) These systems contain questions and answers to standard testing materials, the disclosure of which would compromise the fairness of the future use of these materials. It is not feasible to develop entirely new examinations after each administration as would be necessary if questions or answers were available for inspection and copying. Consequently, exemption from subsection (d) is claimed.
</P>
<P>(ii) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do not apply because these systems are exempt from the provisions of subsection (d). Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of its notification, access, and contest procedures because access is appropriate in some cases.

<HEAD>§ 266.9   Computer matching.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> Any agency or Postal Service component that wishes to use records from a Postal Service automated system of records in a computerized comparison with other postal or non-postal records must submit its proposal to the Postal Service Privacy and Records Management Office. Computer matching programs as defined in § 262.5(c) must be conducted in accordance with the Privacy Act, as amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988. Records may not be exchanged for a matching program until all procedural requirements of the Act and these regulations have been met. Other matching activities must be conducted in accordance with the Privacy Act and with the approval of the Privacy and Records Management Office. See § 266.3(b)(6).
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Procedure for submission of matching proposals.</I> A proposal must include information required for the matching agreement discussed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The Inspection Service must submit its proposals for matching programs and other matching activities to the Privacy and Records Management Office through: Counsel, Inspection Service, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20260. All other matching proposals, whether from postal organizations or other government agencies, must be mailed directly to: Privacy and Records Management Office, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW., Washington, DC 20260-1101.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Lead time.</I> Proposals must be submitted to the Postal Service Privacy and Records Management Office at least three months in advance of the anticipated starting date to allow time to meet Privacy Act publication and review requirements.
</P>
<P>(d<I>) Matching agreements.</I> The participants in a computer matching program must enter into a written agreement specifying the terms under which the matching program is to be conducted. The Privacy and Records Management Office may require similar written agreements for other matching activities.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Content.</I> Agreements must specify:
</P>
<P>(i) The purpose and legal authority for conducting the matching program;
</P>
<P>(ii) The justification for the program and the anticipated results, including, when appropriate, a specific estimate of any savings in terms of expected costs and benefits, in sufficient detail for the Data Integrity Board to make an informed decision;
</P>
<P>(iii) A description of the records that are to be matched, including the data elements to be used, the number of records, and the approximate dates of the matching program;
</P>
<P>(iv) Procedures for providing notice to individuals who supply information that the information may be subject to verification through computer matching programs;
</P>
<P>(v) Procedures for verifying information produced in a matching program and for providing individuals an opportunity to contest the findings in accordance with the requirement that an agency may not take adverse action against an individual as a result of information produced by a matching program until the agency has independently verified the information and provided the individual with due process;
</P>
<P>(vi) Procedures for ensuring the administrative, technical, and physical security of the records matched; for the retention and timely destruction of records created by the matching program; and for the use and return or destruction of records used in the program;
</P>
<P>(vii) Prohibitions concerning duplication and redisclosure of records exchanged, except where required by law or essential to the conduct of the matching program;
</P>
<P>(viii) Assessments of the accuracy of the records to be used in the matching program; and
</P>
<P>(ix) A statement that the Comptroller General may have access to all records of the participant agencies in order to monitor compliance with the agreement.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Approval.</I> Before the Postal Service may participate in a computer matching program or other computer matching activity that involves both USPS and non-USPS records, the Data Integrity Board must have evaluated the proposed match and unanimously approved the terms of the matching agreement. Agreements are executed by the Chairman of the Board. If a matching agreement is disapproved by the Board, any party may appeal the disapproval in writing to the Director, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, within 30 days following the Board's written disapproval.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Effective dates.</I> The agreement will become effective in accordance with the date in the matching agreement and as provided to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget and published in the <E T="04">Federal Register.</E> The agreement remains in effect only as long as necessary to accomplish the specific matching purpose, but no longer than 18 months, at which time the agreement expires unless extended. The Data Integrity Board may extend an agreement for one additional year, without further review, if within three months prior to expiration of the 18-month period it finds that the matching program is to be conducted without change, and each party to the agreement certifies that the program has been conducted in compliance with the matching agreement. Renewal of a continuing matching program that has run for the full 30-month period requires a new agreement that has received Data Integrity Board approval.

In implementation of these requirements, the following rules of conduct apply: 
</P>
<P>(a) Except as specifically authorized in § 266.4(b)(2) of this chapter, no employee shall disclose, directly or indirectly, the contents of any record about another individual to any person or organization. Managers are to provide guidance in this regard to all employees who must handle such information.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>No employee will maintain a secret system of records about individuals.</I> All records systems containing personally identifiable information about individuals must be reported to the Manager, Records Office.

<HEAD>§ 310.1   Definitions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Letter</I> is a message directed to a specific person or address and recorded in or on a tangible object, subject to the following:
</P>
<P>(1) Tangible objects used for letters include, but are not limited to, paper (including paper in sheet or card form), recording disks, and magnetic tapes. Tangible objects used for letters do not include (i) objects the material or shape and design of which make them valuable or useful for purposes other than as media for long-distance communications, unless they are actually used as media for personal and business correspondence, and (ii) outsized, rigid objects not capable of enclosure in envelopes, sacks, boxes or other containers commonly used to transmit letters or packets of letters.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Message</I> means any information or intelligence that can be recorded as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. 
</P>
<P>(3) A message is directed to a “specific person or address” when, for example, it, or the container in which it is carried, singly or with other messages, identical or different, is marked for delivery to a specific person or place, or is delivered to a specific person or place in accordance with a selective delivery plan. Selective delivery plans include delivery to particular persons or addresses by use of detached address labels or cards; address lists; memorized groups of addresses; or “piggy-backed” delivery with addressed articles of merchandise, publications, or other items. Selective delivery plans do not include distributions of materials without written addresses to passersby on a particular street corner, or to all residents or randomly selected residents of an area. A message bearing the name or address of a specific person or place is a letter even if it is intended by the sender to be read or otherwise used by some person or persons other than or in addition to the addressee. 
</P>
<P>(4) Methods by which messages are recorded on tangible objects include, but are not limited to, the use of written or printed characters, drawing, holes, or orientations of magnetic particles in a manner having a predetermined significance. 
</P>
<P>(5) Whether a tangible object bears a message is to be determined on an objective basis without regard to the intended or actual use made of the object sent. 
</P>
<P>(6) Identical messages directed to more than one specific person or address or separately directed to the same person or address constitute separate letters. 
</P>
<P>(7) The following are not letters within the meaning of these regulations: 
<SU>1</SU>
<FTREF/>
</P>
<FTNT>
<P>
<SU>1</SU> Several of the items enumerated in this paragraph (a)(7) do not self-evidently lie outside of the definition of “letter”. To the extent, however, that there is any question whether these items may properly be excluded by definition, the Postal Service has determined by adoption of these regulations that the restrictions of the Private Express Statutes are suspended pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 601(b).</P></FTNT>
<P>(i) Telegrams. 
</P>
<P>(ii) Checks, drafts, promissory notes, bonds, other negotiable and nonnegotiable financial instruments, stock certificates, other securities, insurance policies, and title policies when shipped to, from, or between financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>(A) As used above, <I>checks</I> and <I>drafts</I> include documents intrinsically related to and regularly accompanying the movement of checks or drafts within the banking system. “Checks” do not include materials accompanying the movement of checks to financial institutions from persons who are not financial institutions, or vice versa, except such materials as would qualify under § 310.3(a) if “checks” were treated as cargo. Specifically, for example, “checks” do not include bank statements sent to depositors showing deposits, debits, and account balances. 
</P>
<P>(B) As used above, <I>financial institutions</I> means: 
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) As to checks and drafts: banks, savings banks, savings and loan institutions, credit unions, and their offices, affiliates, and facilities. 
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) As to other instruments: institutions performing functions involving the bulk generation, clearance, and transfer of such instruments.
</P>
<P>(iii) Abstracts of title, mortgages and other liens, deeds, leases, releases, articles of incorporation, papers filed in lawsuits or formal quasi-judicial proceedings, and orders of courts and of quasi-judicial bodies.
</P>
<P>(iv) Newspapers and periodicals. 
</P>
<P>(v) Books and catalogs consisting of 24 or more bound pages with at least 22 printed, and telephone directories. Separate letters of less than 24 bound and 22 printed pages bound to other material do not qualify for this exclusion. In determining whether separate letters have been bound to other material, the following factors will be considered, along with any other relevant factors: Whether the parts are visually similar; whether the parts were printed and bound together at the same time and by the same process; whether the binding serves an important purpose and has been a longstanding practice; and whether the same individual reads all parts of the bound document. Ordinarily, books and catalogs deal with matters of interest to, and are intended for, a substantial number of recipients. In addition, books generally contain a substantial number of pages. Accordingly, this exclusion will not apply when the nature of the message conveyed, the limited numbers of published copies and of recipients, the limited number of pages, or other relevant factors suggest that it is not appropriate to treat the material as a book or catalog. An item distributed privately, or privately and by mail, to fewer than 25 separate persons or places will generally not be treated as a book or catalog falling within this exclusion. 
</P>
<P>(vi) Matter sent from a printer, stationer, or similar source, to a person ordering such matter for use as his letters. This exclusion applies whether or not the printer, stationer, or similar source is owned by or affiliated with the person who orders such matter for use as his letters.
</P>
<P>(vii) Letters sent to a records storage center exclusively for storage, letters sent exclusively for destruction, letters retrieved from a records storage center, and letters sent as part of a household or business relocation.
</P>
<P>(viii) Tags, labels, stickers, signs or posters the type-size, layout or physical characteristics of which indicate they are primarily intended to be attached to other objects for reading.
</P>
<P>(ix) Photographic material being sent by a person to a processor and processed photographic material being returned from the processor to the person sending the material for processing.
</P>
<P>(x) Copy sent from a person to an independent or company-owned printer or compositor, or between printers and compositors, and proofs or printed matter returned from the printer or compositor to the office of the person who initially sent the copy.
</P>
<P>(xi) Sound recordings, films, and packets of identical printed letters containing messages all or the overwhelming bulk of which are to be disseminated to the public. The “public” does not include individuals residing at the place of address; individuals employed by the organization doing business at the place of address (whether or not the actual place of employment is the place of address); individuals who are members of an organization, if an organization is located at the place of address; or other individuals who, individually or as members of a group, are reasonably identifiable to the sender.
</P>
<P>(xii) Computer programs recorded on media suitable for direct input. For the conditions under which the Private Express Statutes are suspended for data processing materials, see § 320.2.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Packet</I> means two or more letters, identical or different, or two or more packets of letters, under one cover or otherwise bound together. As used in these regulations, unless the context otherwise requires, “letter” or “letters” includes “packet” or “packets”.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Person</I> means an individual, corporation, association, partnership, governmental agency, or other organization or entity.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Post routes</I> are routes on which mail is carried by the Postal Service, and includes post roads as defined in 39 U.S.C. 5003, as follows: 
</P>
<P>(1) The waters of the United States, during the time the mail is carried thereon; 
</P>
<P>(2) Railroads or parts of railroads and air routes in operation; 
</P>
<P>(3) Canals, during the time the mail is carried thereon; 
</P>
<P>(4) Public roads, highways, and toll roads during the time the mail is carried thereon; and 
</P>
<P>(5) Letter-carrier routes established for the collection and delivery of mail. 
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Private carriage, private carrier,</I> and terms of similar import used in connection with the Private Express Statutes or these regulations mean carriage by anyone other than the Postal Service, regardless of any meaning ascribed to similar terms under other bodies of law or regulation. 
</P>
<P>(f) The <I>Private Express Statutes</I> are set forth in 18 U.S.C. 1693-1699 and 39 U.S.C. 601-606 (1970).

<HEAD>§ 310.2   Unlawful carriage of letters.</HEAD>
<P>(a) It is generally unlawful under the Private Express Statutes for any person other than the Postal Service in any manner to send or carry a letter on a post route or in any manner to cause or assist such activity. Violation may result in injunction, fine or imprisonment or both and payment of postage lost as a result of the illegal activity (see § 310.5). 
</P>
<P>(b) Activity described in paragraph (a) of this section is lawful with respect to a letter if:
</P>
<P>(1)(i) The letter is enclosed in an envelope or other suitable cover; 
</P>
<P>(ii) The amount of postage which would have been charged on the letter if it had been sent through the Postal Service is paid by stamps, or postage meter stamps, on the cover or by other methods approved by the Postal Service; 
</P>
<P>(iii) The name and address of the person for whom the letter is intended appear on the cover; 
</P>
<P>(iv) The cover is so sealed that the letter cannot be taken from it without defacing the cover; 
</P>
<P>(v) Any stamps on the cover are canceled in ink by the sender; and 
</P>
<P>(vi) The date of the letter, or of its transmission or receipt by the carrier, is endorsed on the cover in ink by the sender or carrier, as appropriate; or 
</P>
<P>(2)(i) The activity is in accordance with the terms of a written agreement between the shipper or the carrier of the letter and the Postal Service. Such an agreement may include some or all of the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or it may change them, but it must:
</P>
<P>(A) Adequately ensure payment of an amount equal to the postage to which the Postal Service would have been entitled had the letters been carried in the mail;
</P>
<P>(B) Remain in effect for a specified period (subject to renewals); and
</P>
<P>(C) Provide for periodic review, audit, and inspection.
</P>
<P>(ii) Possible alternative arrangements may include but are not limited to:
</P>
<P>(A) Payment of a fixed sum at specified intervals based on the shipper's projected shipment of letters for a given period, as verified by the Postal Service; or
</P>
<P>(B) Utilization of a computer record to determine the volume of letters shipped during an interval and the applicable postage to be remitted to the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>(c) The Postal Service may suspend the operation of any part of paragraph (b) of this section where the public interest requires the suspension.
</P>
<P>(d) Activity described in paragraph (a) of this section is permitted with respect to letters which:
</P>
<P>(1) Relate to some part of the cargo of, or to some article carried at the same time by, the conveyance carrying it (see § 310.3(a));

<DIV8 N="§ 310.3" NODE="39:1.0.1.5.40.0.1.3" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 310.3   Exceptions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Cargo.</I> The sending or carrying of letters is permissible if they accompany and relate in all substantial respects to some part of the cargo or to the ordering, shipping or delivering of the cargo.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Letters of the carrier.</I> (1) The sending or carrying of letters is permissible if they are sent by or addressed to the person carrying them. If the individual actually carrying the letters is not the person sending the letters or to whom the letters are addressed, then such individual must be an officer or employee of such person (see § 310.3(b)(2)) and the letters must relate to the current business of such person.
</P>
<P>(2) The fact that the individual actually carrying the letters may be an officer or employee of the person sending the letters or to whom the letters are addressed for certain purposes does not necessarily mean that he is an officer or employee for purposes of this exception. The following factors bear on qualifications for the exception: the carrying employee is employed for a substantial time, if not fulltime (letters must not be privately carried by casual employees); the carrying employee carries no matter for other senders; the carrying employee is a regular salaried employee and shares in all privileges enjoyed by other regular employees (including employees not engaged primarily by the letter carrying function), including but not limited to salary, annual vacation time, absence allowed for illness, health benefits, workmen's compensation insurance, and retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>(3) Separately incorporated carriers are separate entities for purposes of this exception, regardless of any subsidiary, ownership, or leasing arrangement. When, however, two concerns jointly operate an enterprise with joint employees and share directly in its revenues and expenses, either of the concerns may carry the letters of the joint enterprise. 
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Private hands without compensation.</I> The sending or carrying of letters without compensation is permitted. Compensation generally consists of a monetary payment for services rendered. Compensation may also consist, however, of non-monetary valuable consideration and of good will Thus, for example, when a business relationship exists or is sought between the carrier and its user, carriage by the carrier of the user's letter will ordinarily not fall under this exception; or, when a person is engaged in the transportation of goods or persons for hire, his carrying of letters “free of charge” for customers whom he does charge for the carriage of goods or persons does not fall under this exception. 
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Special messenger.</I> (1) The use of a special messenger employed for the particular occasion only is permissible to transmit letters if not more than twenty-five letters are involved. The permission granted under this exception is restricted to use of messenger service on an infrequent, irregular basis by the sender or addressee of the message. 
</P>
<P>(2) A special messenger is a person who, at the request of either the sender or the addressee, picks up a letter from the sender's home or place of business and carries it to the addressees home or place of business, but a messenger or carrier operating regularly between fixed points is not a special messenger. 
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Carriage prior or subsequent to mailing.</I> (1) The private carriage of letters which enter the mail stream at some point between their origin and their destination is permissible. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, however, the carriage of letters from a place where they have been opened, read, separated, or otherwise utilized, does not fall within this exception even though such letters had previously been in the mail stream. Similarly, the carriage of letters to a place where they will be consolidated or otherwise utilized does not fall within this exception even though they will subsequently enter the mail stream. 
</P>
<P>(2) Examples of permitted activities are the pickup and carriage of letters which are delivered to post offices for mailing; the pickup and carriage of letters at post offices for delivery to addressees; and the bulk shipment of individually addressed letters ultimately carried by the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>(3) The private carriage of letters from branches of an organization to a location for preparation for mailing does not constitute a consolidation. The private carriage of letters from an organization's point of mail delivery to its branches in the locality does not constitute a separation.

<HEAD>§ 320.2   Suspension for certain data processing materials.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The operation of 39 U.S.C. 601(a) (1) through (6) and § 310.2(b) (1) through (6) of this chapter is suspended on all post routes for data processing materials defined in paragraph (c) of this section on the terms detailed in paragraph (b) of this section, subject to the operating requirements in § 320.3.
</P>
<P>(b) The suspension referred to in paragraph (a) of this section is for data processing materials conveyed (1) to a data processing center, if carriage is completed within 12 hours or by noon of the addressee's next business day and if data processing work is commenced on such materials within 36 hours of their receipt at the center; or (2) back from the data processing center to the address of the office originating the incoming materials, if carriage is completed within 12 hours or by noon of the addressee's next business day, and if data processing work was commenced on the incoming materials within 36 hours of their receipt at the center. For purposes of the time limitations for completion of delivery referred to in the preceding sentence, delivery of shipments between a domestic point and a foreign point shall be deemed to begin at the time materials of foreign origin are received at the international gateway city or end at the time materials of domestic origin leave the international gateway city. This suspension does not apply to carriages from or to originating offices that are neither part of the firm owning the data processing center nor data processing customers of the firm owning the data processing center.
</P>
<P>(c) For purposes of this suspension, (1) “addressee's next business day” means the first calendar day, stated in his local time, on which he conducts business, following the calendar day of dispatch, stated in the sender's local time; (2) “data processing” means electro-mechanical or electronic processing and includes the recording of data by electro-mechanical or electronic means for further processing; and (3) “data processing materials” means materials of all types that are sent exclusively for data processing and are ready for immediate data processing, but only if they are produced recurringly in the course of the normal business operations of the office originating them or receiving them back from the processing center. The performance of clerical work which is merely preparatory and incidental to the commencement of data processing is not, for purposes of this suspension, inconsistent with the requirement that the materials be sent exclusively for data processing and be ready for immediate data processing.

<P>(a) Carriers intending to establish or alter operations based on the suspension granted pursuant to § 320.2 shall, as a condition to the right to operate under the suspension, notify the Manager, Mailing Standards, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Rm. 3436, Washington, DC 20260-3436, of their intention to establish such operations not later than the beginning of such operations. Such notification, on a form available from the office of Mailing Standards, shall include information on the identity and authority of the carrier and the scope of its proposed operations.

The provisions of this paragraph shall not restrict the Postal Service in the exercise of search powers conferred upon it by law.

<P>(c) The filing of notifications under this section does not relieve the operator of responsibility for assuring that its operations conform to applicable statutes and regulations.

<HEAD>§ 320.6   Suspension for extremely urgent letters.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The operation of 39 U.S.C. 601(a) (1) through (6) and § 310.2(b) (1) through (6) of this chapter is suspended on all post routes for extremely urgent letters if the conditions of either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, and of the other paragraphs of this section, are met.
</P>
<P>(b)(1) For letters dispatched within 50 miles of the intended destination, delivery of those dispatched by noon must be completed within 6 hours or by the close of the addressee's normal business hours that day, whichever is later, and delivery of those dispatched after noon and before midnight must be completed by 10 A.M. of the addressee's next business day. For other letters, delivery must be completed within 12 hours or by noon of the addressee's next business day. The suspension is available only if the value or usefulness of the letter would be lost or greatly diminished if it is not delivered within these time limits. For any part of a shipment of letters to qualify under this paragraph (b), each of the letters must be extremely urgent.
</P>
<P>(2) Letters sent from the 48 contiguous states of the United States to other jurisdictions of the United States or to other nations are deemed “delivered” when they are in the custody of the international or overseas carrier at its last scheduled point of departure from the 48 contiguous states. Letters sent from other jurisdictions of the United States or from other nations into the 48 contiguous states are deemed “dispatched” when they are in the custody of the domestic carrier, having been passed by United States Customs, if applicable, at the letters' point of arrival in the 48 contiguous states.
</P>
<P>(3) Except as provided in this paragraph (b)(3), the times and time limits specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not applicable to any locations outside the 48 contiguous states. The times and time limits specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are applicable to letters dispatched and delivered wholly within Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico or a territory or possession of the United States. The regulations provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section relating to the delivery and dispatch of letters are applicable by analogy to letters shipped between these jurisdictions and other nations.
</P>
<P>(c) It will be conclusively presumed that a letter is extremely urgent and is covered by the suspension if the amount paid for private carriage of the letter is at least three dollars or twice the applicable U.S. postage for First-Class Mail (including priority mail) whichever is the greater. If a single shipment consists of a number of letters that are picked up together at a single origin and delivered together to a single destination, the applicable U.S. postage may be computed for purposes of this paragraph as though the shipment constituted a single letter of the weight of the shipment. If not actually charged on a letter-by-letter or shipment-by-shipment basis, the amount paid may be computed for purposes of this paragraph on the basis of the carrier's actual charge divided by a <I>bona fide</I> estimate of the average number of letters or shipments during the period covered by the carrier's actual charge. 
</P>
<P>(d) The sender must prominently mark the outside covers or containers of letters carried under this suspension with the words “Extremely Urgent” or “Private Carriage Authorized by Postal Regulations (39 CFR 320.6)” or with a similar legend identifying the letters as carried pursuant to this suspension. In addition, each outside container or cover must show the name and address of the carrier, and the name and address of the addressee. Carrier records must be sufficient to show that the delivery of the letters was completed within the applicable time limitations, if carried under the authority of paragraph (b) of this section, and must be made available for inspection at the request of the Postal Service. The required records may be either in the form of notations on the containers or covers of any letters asserted to be carried under this suspension, or in the form of records kept by employees of the actual times they pick up and deliver such materials.
</P>
<P>(e) Violation by a shipper or carrier of the terms of this suspension is grounds for administrative revocation of the suspension as to such shipper or carrier for a period of one year in a proceeding instituted by the General Counsel, following a hearing by the Judicial Officer Department in accordance with the rules of procedure set out in Part 959 of this chapter. The period of the revocation may be reduced or be extended for not to exceed one additional year by the Judicial Officer, depending on such mitigating or aggravating factors as the extent of the postal revenue lost because of the violation and the presence or absence of good faith error or of previous violations. The failure of a shipper or carrier to cooperate with an authorized inspection or audit conducted by the Postal Inspection Service for the purpose of determining compliance with the terms of this suspension shall be deemed to create a presumption of a violation for the purpose of this paragraph (e) and shall shift to the shipper or carrier the burden of establishing the fact of compliance. Revocation of this suspension as to a shipper or carrier shall in no way limit other actions as to such shipper or carrier to enforce the Private Express Statutes by administrative proceedings for collection of postage (see § 310.5) or by civil or criminal proceedings.
</P>
<P>(f) The following examples illustrate the application of this suspension.
</P>
<EXAMPLE>
<HED>Example (1).</HED><PSPACE>The headquarters of a city police department each night compiles a list of the license plate numbers and descriptions of automobiles reported stolen within the metropolitan area during the previous 24 hours. This list is delivered by 7 a.m. the following day to each of the local precinct offices located throughout the city. By 9 a.m. that day, the list is circulated for use by law enforcement units operating from each office. Effective police recovery of stolen vehicles depends upon having this information handed out in written form to all units on at least a daily basis. The private carriage of these lists would qualify under the test set in paragraph (b) of this section.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE>
<EXAMPLE>
<HED>Example (2).</HED><PSPACE>The same police department headquarters also from time to time distributes memoranda advising the local precinct officers on departmental policy and vacation schedules, and responding to inquiries from the local precinct offices. Nothing substantial turns on whether these memoranda arrive by midnight or by 10 a.m. of the next business day or whether their transmission takes a day or more longer to complete. The private carriage of these memoranda would not qualify under the test set out in paragraph (b) of this section.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE>
<EXAMPLE>
<HED>Example (3).</HED><PSPACE>A health maintenance organization (HMO) operating its own hospital, clinics, and medical laboratory daily sends test samples and specimens from the HMO's hospital and clinics to its medical laboratory in a different location for immediate analysis. In return, the HMO laboratory sends to the HMO's hospital and clinics the laboratory reports for these samples and specimens on the day the reports are completed. The reports are then promptly utilized by the hospital and clinics as part of regular diagnostic procedures. The private carriage of these reports would qualify under the loss-of-value test set out in paragraph (b) of this section.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE>
<EXAMPLE>
<HED>Example (4).</HED><PSPACE>The same HMO's hospital and clinics send requisitions and invoices to the HMO's central office as the need arises for the ordering of and payment for goods and services, which are handled centrally. Every other Friday, the central office sends to the hospital and clinics reports and memoranda on expenditures for personnel, supplies, utilities, and other goods and services. Nothing substantial turns on whether these materials arrive the same day or by 10 a.m. of the next business day or whether their transmission takes a day or more longer to complete. The private carriage of these materials would not qualify under the test set out in paragraph (b) of this section.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE>
<EXAMPLE>
<HED>Example (5).</HED><PSPACE>On Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings, the central office of a regional grocery store chain sends out to its various stores in the area inventory bulletins prepared over the previous 24 hours showing the current availability and prices of meat, produce, dairy products, breadstuffs, frozen foods and similar items. Early the following afternoon, each store must send these inventory bulletins back to the central office with a notation of the store's orders to assure that the central office can ship sufficient supplies of such items for sale by the store on its next business day. The private carriage of these bulletins would qualify under the test set out in paragraph (b) of this section.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE>
<EXAMPLE>
<HED>Example (6).</HED><PSPACE>On Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings, the central office of a different regional grocery chain sends out to its various stores in the area inventory bulletins showing the current availability and prices of meat, produce, dairy products, breadstuffs, frozen foods and similar items. Early in the afternoon of the second day following receipt of the bulletins, each store sends the bulletins back to the central office so that supplies of such items may be shipped to the store four days later. Nothing substantial turns on whether these bulletins arrive within 12 hours or by noon of the next business day or whether their transmission takes a day or more longer to complete. The private carriage of these materials would not qualify under the test set out in paragraph (b) of this section.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE>
<EXAMPLE>
<HED>Example (7).</HED><PSPACE>The headquarters office of a large bank each business day prepares and sends to its branch offices lists showing current foreign exchange rates and similar information that must be updated and distributed to the branches on a daily basis in order for the bank to avoid the risk of serious financial loss. Within three hours of their receipt by each branch office, these lists are circulated and utilized by officials of the branch office in conducting regular banking procedures involving the use of such lists. The private carriage of these lists would qualify under the test set out in paragraph (b) of this section.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE>
<EXAMPLE>
<HED>Example (8).</HED><PSPACE>The field office of an insurance company daily sends the insurance applications it has taken in that day to the company's central office. The applications are bound (<I>i.e.</I>, constitute evidence of insurance) for 30 days, but may be canceled by the company. Few if any policies have been canceled by the company within 48 hours of their receipt at the central office, though the company normally begins processing the applications soon after their receipt. Nothing substantial turns on whether these bound applications arrive within 12 hours or by noon of the next business day or whether their transmission takes a day or more longer to complete. The private carriage of these materials would not qualify under the test set out in paragraph (b) of this section.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE>
<EXAMPLE>
<HED>Example (9).</HED><PSPACE>An organization of real estate brokers in a community issues periodic bulletins containing information about properties which have been listed for sale by the constituent brokers. Each broker is entitled to show the properties to prospective buyers. In order to provide each broker with substantially equal opportunity to secure a buyer, it is necessary that the bulletins be delivered on the same day and within the shortest time span within that day. The bulletins constitute the basic source of information for the brokers and delivery in the foregoing manner is a key element in the functioning of the brokers. The private carriage of the bulletins would therefore qualify under the test set out in paragraph (b) of this section.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE>
<EXAMPLE>
<HED>Example (10).</HED><PSPACE>The same organization distributes memoranda regarding speakers at real estate seminars, sales figures for a given period, and other information of significance and interest to real estate brokers but which does not affect their competitive positions. A failure to make simultaneous or near simultaneous delivery to the brokers, or a failure to make delivery within a specified period of time, has no material bearing upon the day-to-day operations of the brokers and private carriage of these materials would not qualify under the test set out in paragraph (b) of this section.</PSPACE></EXAMPLE>

The Ethical Conduct Officer shall provide advice and guidance for the Postmaster General and all Associate Ethical Conduct Officers concerning questions arising under the Standards and Supplemental Regulations. The Ethical Conduct Officer may delegate to an Assistant Ethical Conduct Officer authority to perform any duty or function vested in him or her by this Section. The General Counsel is the Ethical Conduct Officer of the Postal Service and the Designated Agency Ethics Official for purposes of the Ethics in Government Act, as amended, and implementing regulations of the Office of Government Ethics, including 5 CFR part 2638.

<P>(a) An employee may seek, accept, or hold a nonpartisan State or local office subject to the provisions of this Code and in particular this section. A “nonpartisan” office is one filled by a “nonpartisan election”, which is an election at which none of the candidates are to be nominated or elected as representing a political party any of whose candidates for presidential elector received votes in the last preceding election at which presidential electors were selected.

<P>(3) Whether the duties of the office would result in a conflict with his Postal Service employment.

<P>(c) An employee is encouraged to seek advice from his Associate Ethical Conduct Counselor prior to taking any action to seek, accept, or hold a State or local office. If, after the employee has entered upon the discharge of the duties of this non-postal office, his non-postal duties interfere with the proper discharge of postal duties, either by him or by other postal employees, the employee holding the non-postal office shall be advised by his superior to eliminate the interference, either by resignation from the non-postal office, or in such other manner as is appropriate under the circumstances. If the employee fails, refuses, or neglects to comply with the foregoing advice and the interference continues, he will be subject to disciplinary proceedings.

The Authorized Agent shall have sole authority to receive service of legal process in the nature of garnishment (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “process”) arising under the law of any state, territory, or possession, or the order of a court of competent jurisdiction of any state, territory, or possession (including any order for child support and alimony or bankruptcy). The Authorized Agent may not receive or transmit service of process in a private legal matter on behalf of an employee. No process shall be effectively served until it is received by the Authorized Agent or his designee. No other employee shall have the authority to accept service of such process. Service of process in conformity with Rule 4(i) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. Appendix) is not waived for any suit or action wherein the Postal Service, its officers, or employees are parties.

No garnishment is effectively served until it is received by the Authorized Agent or his designee regardless of the chosen mode of delivery. Process addressed to, delivered to, or in any manner given to any employee, other than the Authorized Agent or his designee, may, at the sole discretion of the employee, be returned to the issuing court marked “Not Effectively Served.” A copy of or reference to these regulations may be included.

Child support and alimony garnishments will be accorded priority over commercial garnishments under 5 U.S.C. 5520a as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5520a(h)(2). Garnishments shall be executed provided that the pay cycle is open for input or, if closed, will be held until the next cycle. In no event shall the Postal Service be required to vary its normal pay or disbursement cycles in order to comply with legal process of any kind. Garnishments shall be recalculated, if required, to fit within the normal postal pay cycles. The Postal Service shall not be required to withhold pay and hold the funds in escrow. The Postal Service, in its sole discretion, may process more than one garnishment at a time within the restrictions on garnishments in Section 491.9 of these regulations. The Postal Service may, in its sole discretion, accept and hold for processing garnishments received after the garnishment currently in force.
</P>
<P>(b) The Postal Service will only accept and effectuate legal process for a person who is currently employed. Upon cessation of employment, process relating to that individual will be terminated and not retained. The Postal Service shall not be required to establish an escrow account to comply with legal process even if the applicable law of the jurisdiction requires private employers to do so. Legal process must state on its face that the Postal Service withhold up to a specific total amount of money, the Postal Service will not calculate interest, charges, or any variable in processing a garnishment. The Postal Service may continue processing a garnishment if the garnishing attorney provides the adjusted total including the additional money owed, as determined from his calculation of the variable amounts. The attorney is deemed to certify on his professional responsibility that the calculations are correct and will indemnify the employee directly for any errors. All garnishments of periodic pay may be effectuated in accordance with the bi-weekly pay schedule. The Postal Service need not vary its pay and disbursement cycles to accommodate withholding on any other cycle.
</P>
<P>(c) Neither the Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission nor any disbursing officer shall be liable for any payment made from moneys due from, or payable by the Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission to any individual pursuant to legal process regular on its face.
</P>
<P>(d) The Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission, any disbursing officer or any other employee shall not be liable to pay money damages for failure to comply with legal process.

<HEAD>§ 501.1   Definitions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Postage Evidencing Systems</I> regulated by part 501 produce evidence of prepayment of postage by any method other than postage stamps and permit imprints. A Postage Evidencing System is a device or system of components that a customer uses to generate and print evidence that postage required for mailing has been paid. Postage Evidencing Systems print indicia, such as information-based indicia or intelligent mail indicia to indicate postage payment. They include but are not limited to postage meters and PC Postage systems.
</P>
<P>(b) A <I>postage meter</I> is a USPS-approved Postage Evidencing System that uses a postage security device (PSD) to account for postage purchased and generates evidence of such purchased postage in the form of an indicium, where the PSD is co-located with the printing of the indicium. The term <I>meter</I> as used in this part refers to a postage meter.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>PC Postage products</I> are USPS-approved Postage Evidencing Systems that use a computer, tablet, or similar device as a user interface. PC Postage products may use the internet to download postage to the computer, tablet or similar device. PC Postage products use a mechanism to account for postage that is remote from the printing of the indicium.
</P>
<P>(d) A <I>provider</I> is a person or entity authorized under this section to manufacture and/or distribute Postage Evidencing Systems to customers.
</P>
<P>(e) A <I>manufacturer</I> of postage meters produces postage meters.
</P>
<P>(f) A <I>distributor</I> of postage meters may be a manufacturer who leases postage meters directly to end-user customers or may be an independent entity who leases postage meters to end-user customers on behalf of the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>(g) A <I>customer</I> is a person or entity authorized by the Postal Service to use a Postage Evidencing System as an end user in accordance with <I>Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service,</I> Domestic Mail Manual (DMM), including 604 Postage Payment Methods and Refunds, 4.0 Postage Meters and PC Postage Products (Postage Evidencing Systems).

<DIV8 N="§ 501.2" NODE="39:1.0.1.7.45.0.1.2" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 501.2   Postage Evidencing System provider authorization.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The Postal Service considers Postage Evidencing Systems and their respective infrastructure to be essential to the exercise of its specific powers to prescribe postage and provide evidence of payment of postage under 39 U.S.C. 404(a)(2) and (4).
</P>
<P>(b) Due to the potential for adverse impact upon Postal Service revenue, the following activities may not be engaged in by any person or entity without prior, written approval of the Postal Service. Persons or entities that perform these activities are referred to collectively as Postage Evidencing System (PES) Providers in this section.
</P>
<P>(1) Manufacturing and/or distributing any Postage Evidencing System that generates or produces U.S. postage.
</P>
<P>(2) Repairing, refurbishing, remanufacturing, modifying, or destroying any component of a Postage Evidencing System that accounts for or authorizes the printing of U.S. postage.
</P>
<P>(3) Owning or operating an infrastructure that maintains operating data for the production of U.S. postage, or accounts for U.S. postage purchased for distribution through a Postage Evidencing System.
</P>
<P>(4) Owning or operating an infrastructure that maintains operating data that is used to facilitate registration with the Postal Service of customers of a Postage Evidencing System.
</P>
<P>(c) Approval to become a Postage Evidencing System Provider:
</P>
<P>(1) Any person or entity seeking authorization to become a PES Provider must submit a request to the Postal Service in writing to the Office of Commercial Payment. Once the request is received, the Office of Commercial Payment will provide the applicant the PES Provider Applicant Guide and the Intelligent Mail Indicia Performance Criteria (IMIPC), the IMIPC setting forth PES and indicia specification and requirements. The contact information for Commercial Payment can be found in § 501.2(f).
</P>
<P>(2) The PES Provider Applicant Guide sets forth the process for applicants seeking to become a PES Provider. An applicant is subject to the rules in both that Guide and the IMIPC, while they are attempting to gain approval to become a PES Provider. Although the Guide sets forth the methodology for a PES provider applicant to be approved as a PES provider, it is not a replacement for postal regulations; such regulations govern the process. As such, the Guide will be updated to reflect changes in postal regulations.
</P>
<P>(3) An applicant applying for approval to become a PES Provider must undergo three (3) primary phases which are laid out in the PES Provider Applicant Guide: Applicant Introduction and Letter of Intent; Applicant Qualification and Registration; and PES Evaluation. Each phase includes prerequisites to enter the phase, deliverables expected during that phase, and a requirement of written approval by the Office of Commercial Payment to allow the process to continue to the next phase. Please note that, to the extent that a PES provider applicant seeks to obtain access to the IMIPC, such access should only be granted after the applicant enters into a Non-disclosure agreement with the Postal Service permitting such access and the usage thereof.
</P>
<P>(4) To the extent that an applicant reaches the PES Evaluation phase, then the applicant is governed by Postal Requirements, the IMIPC, and the PES Provider Applicant Guide even though not yet an authorized PES Provider.
</P>
<P>(5) The Postal Service, in its sole discretion, may approve an applicant. In reaching its approval determination, the Postal Service may review factors and make determinations including, but not limited to, satisfactory evidence of the applicant's integrity and financial responsibility, commitment to comply with the Postal Requirements, and a determination that disclosure to the applicant of Postal Service customer, financial, or other data of a commercial nature necessary to perform the function for which approval is sought would be appropriate and consistent with good business practices within the meaning of 39 U.S.C. 410(c)(2).
</P>
<P>(6) No applicant is considered a PES Provider until the Postal Service issues a final written decision. This is accomplished by the provision of a final approval of the applicant's status as an authorized PES Provider in writing from the Vice President of Mail Entry &amp; Payment Technology (or successor). The applicant is approved in writing to engage in the function(s) for which authorization was sought and approved.
</P>
<P>(d) To the extent that any person or entity is approved to be a PES Provider, such PES Provider must adhere to the Postal Requirements.
</P>
<P>(e) As a condition of obtaining authorization under this section, the PES Provider's facilities used for the manufacture, distribution, storage, resetting, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, modifying, or destruction of a Postage Evidencing System and all facilities housing infrastructure supporting Postage Evidencing Systems will be subject to unannounced inspection by representatives of the Postal Service. If such facilities are outside the continental United States, the PES Provider will be responsible for all reasonable and necessary travel-related costs incurred by the Postal Service to conduct the inspections. Travel-related costs are determined in accordance with Postal Service Handbook F-15, Travel and Relocation. At its discretion, the Postal Service may continue to fund routine inspections outside the continental United States as it has in the past, provided the costs are not associated with particular security issues related to a PES Provider's Postage Evidencing System or supporting infrastructure, or with the start-up or implementation of a new plant or of a new or substantially changed manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>(1) When conducting an inspection outside the continental United States, the Postal Service will make every effort to combine the inspection with other inspections in the same general geographic area in order to enable affected PES Providers to share the costs. The Postal Service team conducting such inspections will be limited to the minimum number necessary to conduct the inspection. All air travel will be contracted for at the rates for official government business, when available, under such rules respecting class of travel as apply to those Postal Service representatives inspecting the facility at the time the travel occurs.
</P>
<P>(2) If political or other impediments prevent the Postal Service from conducting security evaluations of Postage Evidencing System facilities in foreign countries, Postal Service approval of the activities conducted in such facilities may be suspended until such time as satisfactory inspections may be conducted.
</P>
<P>(f) The Postal Service office responsible for administration of this part is the Office of Commercial Payment or successor organization. All submissions to the Postal Service required or invited by this part are to be made to this office in person or via mail to 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Room 3500, Washington, DC 20260-0004.

<P>(a) The Postal Service may suspend and/or revoke authorization to manufacture and/or distribute any or all of a provider's approved Postage Evidencing System(s) if the provider engages in any unlawful scheme or enterprise, fails to comply with any provision in this Part 501, fails to implement instructions issued in accordance with any final decision issued by the Postal Service within its authority over Postage Evidencing Systems or if the Postage Evidencing System or infrastructure of the provider is determined to constitute an unacceptable risk to Postal Service revenues.
</P>
<P>(b) The decision to suspend or revoke pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be based upon the nature and circumstances of the violation (<I>e.g.</I> whether the violation was willful, whether the provider voluntarily admitted to the violation, or cooperated with the Postal Service, whether the provider implemented successful remedial measures) and on the provider's performance history. Before determining that a provider's authorization to manufacture and/or distribute Postage Evidencing Systems should be suspended or revoked, the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section shall be followed.
</P>
<P>(c) Suspension or revocation procedures:
</P>
<P>(1) Upon determination by the Postal Service that a provider is in violation of provisions of this part, or that its Postage Evidencing System poses an unreasonable risk to postal revenue, Commercial Payment, acting on behalf of the Postal Service, shall issue a written notice of proposed suspension citing the specific conditions or deficiencies for which suspension of authorization to manufacture and/or distribute a specific Postage Evidencing System or class of Postage Evidencing Systems may be imposed. Except in cases of willful violation, the provider shall be given an opportunity to correct deficiencies and achieve compliance with all requirements within a time limit corresponding to the potential risk to postal revenue.
</P>
<P>(2) In cases of willful violation, or if the Postal Service determines that the provider has failed to correct cited deficiencies within the specified time limit, Commercial Payment shall issue a written notice of suspension setting forth the facts and reasons for the decision to suspend, and the effective date if a written defense is not presented as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) The notice shall also advise the provider of its right to file a response under paragraph (d) of this section. If a written response is not presented in a timely manner the suspension may go into effect. The suspension shall remain in effect for ninety (90) calendar days unless revoked or modified by Commercial Payment.
</P>
<P>(4) If, upon consideration of the defense as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Postal Service deems that the suspension is warranted, the suspension shall remain in effect for up to 90 days unless withdrawn by the Postal Service, as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section.
</P>
<P>(5) At the end of the ninety (90) day suspension, the Postal Service may:
</P>
<P>(i) Extend the suspension in order to allow more time for investigation or to allow the provider time to correct the problem.
</P>
<P>(ii) Make a determination to revoke authorization to manufacture and/or distribute a Postage Evidencing System in part or in whole.
</P>
<P>(iii) Withdraw the suspension based on identification and implementation of a satisfactory solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>(d) The provider may present the Postal Service with a written defense to any suspension or revocation determination within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving the written notice (unless a shorter period is deemed necessary). The defense must include all supporting evidence and state with specificity the reasons why the order should not be imposed.
</P>
<P>(e) After receipt and consideration of the defense, Commercial Payment shall advise the provider of its decision, and the facts and reasons for it. The decision shall be effective upon receipt unless it provides otherwise. The decision shall also advise the provider that it may be appealed within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt (unless a shorter time frame is deemed necessary). If an appeal is not filed in a timely manner, the decision of Commercial Payment shall become a final decision of the Postal Service. The appeal may be filed with the Chief Information Officer of the Postal Service and must include all supporting evidence and state with specificity the reasons the provider believes that the decision is erroneous.

<HEAD>§ 501.15   Computerized Meter Resetting System.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Description.</I> The Computerized Meter Resetting System (CMRS) permits customers to reset their postage meters at their places of business. Authorized providers, who operate CMRS services, are known as resetting companies (RCs).
</P>
<P>(b) A customer is required to have funds available on deposit with the Postal Service before resetting a Postage Evidencing System or the provider may opt to provide a funds advance in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
</P>
<P>(c) If the RC chooses to offer advancement of funds to customers, the RC is required to maintain a deposit with the Postal Service equal to at least one (1) day's average funds advanced. The total amount of funds advanced to customers on any given day shall not exceed the amount the provider has on deposit with the Postal Service. The Postal Service shall not be liable for any payment made by the RC on behalf of a customer that is not reimbursed by the customer, since the RC is solely responsible for the collection of advances made by the RC.
</P>
<P>(d) The CMRS customer is permitted to make deposits in one of three ways: check, electronic funds transfer (or wire transfer), or automated clearinghouse (ACH) transfer. These deposits must be remitted to the Postal Service's designated bank account.
</P>
<P>(e) The RC must require each CMRS customer that requests a meter resetting to provide the meter serial number, the CMRS account number, and the meter's ascending and descending register readings. The RC must verify that there are sufficient funds in the customer's CMRS account to cover the postage setting requested before proceeding with the setting transaction (unless the RC opts to provide the customer a funds advance).
</P>
<P>(f) The Postal Service requires that the RC publicize to all CMRS customers the following payment options (listed in order of preference):
</P>
<P>(1) Automated clearinghouse (ACH) debits/credits.
</P>
<P>(2) Electronic funds transfers (wire transfers).
</P>
<P>(3) Checks.
</P>
<P>(g) The RC must reimburse the Postal Service for returned payments promptly, comply with NACHA rules, and maintain customer ACH debit agreements.
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Financial responsibility for returned payments.</I> The RC is required to reimburse the Postal Service upon request for any returned payments. The RC must, upon first becoming aware of a returned payment, immediately lock the customer's CMRS account to prevent a meter reset until the RC receives confirmation of payment for the returned payment. If a fee, penalty or fine is assessed against the Postal Service for returned payments from an RC's customer, the Postal Service may request reimbursement for such fee, penalty or fine from the RC. The RC is required to remit the amount of the returned payment to the Postal Service plus the reimbursement request, to the extent applicable, within ten (10) banking days. Invoices will be created monthly for returns and/or applicable penalties or fines incurred for the previous month. The ten (10) banking days will start once the invoice is mailed. The RC has discretion to decide whether to charge its customer for any such reimbursement costs (of fees, penalties, or fines) the RC pays to the Postal Service in connection with the customer's returned payment.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Responsibility to comply with NACHA rules.</I> The RC is required to comply with the most recent edition of the NACHA rules, published annually by the North American Clearing House Association. Failure to comply may result in revocation of access to applicable Postal Service ACH programs.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Responsibility to maintain customer ACH agreements.</I> The RC must obtain and store an agreement with each and every customer utilizing ACH debit as a payment method. The customer agreement must authorize the RC to debit the designated bank account identified to pay for postage through the Postal Service account of its choice. The agreement must have at least the following elements: Company Name (if applicable), Name and Title and Address of the person entering into the agreement, Contact Information (Phone Number, Fax Number and eMail Address as applicable), Date and Signature (or appropriate electronic signature evidence) of Agreement, Customer's Bank Name, Bank Routing Number, Account Number and Account Type (Checking or Savings, Business or Personal) being agreed to transact upon, an Attestation that the person submitting the form is authorized to act on behalf of the account, and Termination Date of the Agreement (if applicable). A revision period until August 31, 2024, will be provided to update agreement forms to include the minimum data elements listed. The agreement must be stored for at least two years after termination of the agreement, must be easily reproducible, and must be provided electronically to the Postal Service within three business days of electronic written request by the Postal Service in a format that can be easily and readily used for all NACHA and ACH related purposes including, without limitation, audit and defense of claims. The Postal Service will provide specific written guidance separately if requested. Failure to comply may result in revocation of access to applicable Postal Service ACH programs.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Refunds.</I> The Postal Service will issue a refund in the amount remaining in a customer's Computerized Meter Resetting System account, after such time as the customer provides a written request to the provider, as long as the request meets the Postal Service approved minimum and time frame.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Security and revenue protection.</I> To receive Postal<I> Service</I> approval to continue to operate systems in the postage meters environment, the RC must submit to a periodic examination and provide a System and Organization Control (SOC) 1 Type II Report of its meter system and any other applications and technology infrastructure that may have a material impact on Postal Service revenues, as determined by the Postal Service. Additionally, RC must submit to a periodic examination and provide a SOC 2 Type II Report of its meter system data security, accuracy, processing integrity and data integrity for any applications, reports, and technology infrastructure that may have a material impact on the RC's reports, which the Postal Service relies upon. For the initial SOC 2 Type I report, the Postal Service will provide the control objectives by March 18, 2020. The due date for the initial SOC 2 Type I is July 1, 2020, with the SOC 2 Type II due on August 15, 2021. Both the SOC 1 and SOC 2 examinations shall be performed by a qualified, independent audit firm and shall be conducted in accordance with the Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAEs) No. 18, Service Organizations, developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), as amended or superseded. Expenses associated with such examination shall be incurred by the RC. The examination shall include testing of the operating effectiveness of relevant RC internal controls (SOC 1 Type II SSAE 18 &amp; SOC 2 Type II SSAE 18 Reports). If the service organization uses another service organization (sub-service provider), the RC should consider the nature and materiality of the transactions and data processed by the sub-service organization and the contribution of the sub-service organization's processes and controls in the achievement of the Postal Service's control objectives. Resetting companies are expected to submit any request for changes to control objectives by December 31 of each year, which will be taken under consideration by the Postal Service for review and approval. The Postal Service will provide common control objectives to be covered by the SOC 1 Type II SSAE 18 by January 31 each year. As a result of the examination, the service auditor shall provide the RC and the Postal Service with an opinion on the design and operating effectiveness of the RC's internal controls related to the meter system and any other applications and technology infrastructure considered material to the services provided to the Postal Service by the RC. SOC 1 and SOC 2 examinations are to be conducted on no less than an annual basis, and are to be as of and for the 12 months ended June 30 of each year (except for new contracts for which the examination period will be no less than the period from the contract date to the following June 30, unless otherwise agreed to by the Postal Service). The SOC 1 and SOC 2 examination reports are to be provided to the Postal Service by August 15 of each year. To the extent that internal control weaknesses are identified in a SOC report, the Postal Service requires prompt communication and remediation of such weaknesses and shall have the right to review working papers and engage in discussions about the work performed with the service auditor. The Postal Service requires that all remediation efforts (if applicable) are completed and reported by the RC prior to the Postal Service's fiscal year end (September 30). In addition, the RC will be responsible for evaluating its internal control environment related to the meter system and any other applications and technology infrastructure considered material to the services provided to the Postal Service by the RC, in particular, disclosing changes to internal controls for the period of July 1 to September 30. This evaluation should be documented and submitted to the Postal Service by October 15 of each year. The RC will be responsible for all costs related to the examinations conducted by the service auditor and the RC.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Inspection of records and facilities.</I> The RC must make its facilities that handle the operation of the computerized resetting system and all records about the operation of the system available for inspection by representatives of the Postal Service at all reasonable times. At its discretion, the Postal Service may continue to fund inspections as it has in the past, provided the costs are not associated with a particular security issue related to the RC's meter systems and supporting infrastructure.
</P>
<P>(k) The RC is required to incorporate the following language into its meter rental agreements:
</P>
<EXTRACT>
<HD1>Acknowledgment of Deposit Requirement—Meters
</HD1>
<P>By signing this meter rental agreement, you the customer represent that you have read the <I>Acknowledgment of Deposit Requirement—Meters</I> and are familiar with its terms. You agree that, upon execution of this agreement with the RC, you will also be bound by all terms and conditions of the Acknowledgment of Deposit Requirement—Meters, as it may be amended from time to time.</P></EXTRACT>

<P>(g) <I>Inspection of records and facilities.</I> The provider must make its facilities, which handle the operation of the PC Postage system and all records about the operation of the system, available for inspection by representatives of the Postal Service at all reasonable times.
</P>
<P>(h) To the extent that the customer maintains funds on deposit for the payment of postage, the provider is required to incorporate the following language into its agreements with PC Postage customers:
</P>
<EXTRACT>
<HD1>Acknowledgment of Deposit Requirement—PC Postage
</HD1>
<P>By signing this agreement with the provider, you represent that you have read the Acknowledgment of Deposit Requirement—PC Postage and are familiar with its terms. You agree that, upon execution of this agreement with the provider, you will also be bound by all terms and conditions of the Acknowledgment of Deposit Requirement—PC Postage, as it may be amended from time to time.</P></EXTRACT>
<P>(i) <I>Revenue assurance.</I> (1) The PC Postage provider must support business practices to assure Postal Service revenue and accurate payment from customers. For purposes of this paragraph, <I>PC Postage provider</I> shall mean: <I>providers</I> who offer <I>PC Postage products</I> (as such terms are defined in § 501.1); Click-N-Ship® service; and postage resellers when such resellers transmit postage revenue to the Postal Service in any manner other than through a PC Postage provider. With respect to the reseller transactions described above, the resellers, and not the PC Postage providers who provide the labels, are responsible for complying with this paragraph. For the purpose of this paragraph, a <I>reseller</I> is an entity that obtains postage through a PC Postage provider and is authorized to resell such postage to its customers pursuant to an agreement with the Postal Service. For example, an entity that sells postage to its customers, but uses a PC Postage provider to enable its customers to print postage labels, is a reseller hereunder. If that entity collects postage revenue from its customers and transmits it to the Postal Service directly (instead of through the PC Postage provider) that entity shall be deemed a PC Postage provider hereunder. For the purpose of this paragraph, a <I>customer</I> is the person or entity that deposits the mail piece into the mail system. PC Postage providers must comply with these revenue assurance requirements regardless of whether they have a direct relationship with the customer or sell postage to the customer through one or more resellers.
</P>
<P>(2)(i) For the purposes of this paragraph, a <I>postage adjustment</I> is defined as the difference between the postage or fee actually paid to the Postal Service for a specific service, and the actual postage due to the Postal Service under the published or negotiated rate for that service, as applicable, which shall be calculated as of the time the mail piece is entered into the mailstream.
</P>
<P>(ii) When the collection of a postage adjustment or the provision of a refund is appropriate because a customer has underpaid or overpaid the amount of postage that should have been paid, and such postage adjustment exceeds a threshold amount to be set by the Postal Service from time to time in its discretion, the PC Postage provider must, upon receiving notice from the Postal Service, pay, attempt to collect, or refund, as applicable, the postage adjustment in accordance with paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section. The Postal Service will supply the PC Postage provider with the details necessary to explain the correction and the amount of the postage adjustment to be used in the adjustment process. As part of this process, the PC Postage provider shall enable customers to submit disputes concerning the postage adjustment to the Postal Service, in a method approved by the Postal Service, including via phone call to the customer care center or API in the PC Postage provider's user interface of postage collections. In addition, the PC Postage provider must convey the Postal Service's dispute decision to the customer. If the Postal Service determines the customer's dispute was valid, and the customer had already paid the postage adjustment, the PC Postage provider must return the postage adjustment to the customer when notified by the Postal Service according to the rules set forth in paragraph (i)(2)(iii)(B) of this section.
</P>
<P>(iii)(A) In the case of an underpayment that exceeds the threshold amount, within 14 business days of receiving notice of the underpayment from the Postal Service the PC Postage provider must pay the postage adjustment directly to the Postal Service, or seek to collect the postage adjustment from the customer in accordance with this paragraph. If the PC Postage provider opts to pursue collection activity, it must notify the customer of the details of the postage adjustment (including the dispute process), retain evidence that such notice was actually received by the customer, and attempt to collect the postage adjustment by adjusting the funds available to the customer in the Postage Evidencing System, or if funds are not available, facilitating customer payment by invoicing the customer or by pursuing other methods available to collect against the customer or access funds of the customer. If the customer has a Postage Evidencing System account, the PC Postage provider must process any refunds due to the customer under paragraph (i)(2)(iii)(B) of this section before processing any collections due to the Postal Service hereunder. If the PC Postage provider opts to pursue collection activity, it shall continue to make affirmative efforts to collect the postage adjustment from the customer until the postage adjustment is satisfied in whole or the collection period (as defined in paragraph (i)(2)(iii)(C) of this section) expires. Immediately upon receiving or securing access to funds of the customer, the PC Postage provider shall remit to the Postal Service any and all available funds from the customer's account from the Postage Evidencing System or that are otherwise recovered by the PC Postage provider to the extent necessary to satisfy the postage adjustment. The postage adjustment must be paid in full; no partial payments will be accepted by the Postal Service, except for payments made under paragraph paragraph (i)(2)(iii)(C) of this section.
</P>
<P>(B) In the case of an overpayment that exceeds the threshold amount, the Postal Service shall within 14 business days of identifying the overpayment, provide notice of the postage adjustment to the PC Postage provider and instruct the PC Postage provider to give the customer a credit and adjust the funds available to the customer in the Postage Evidencing System. If the Postage Evidencing System account has been closed or for customers who do not have individual Postage Evidencing System accounts, the Postal Service shall instruct the PC Postage provider to issue a refund to the customer and the Postal Service shall either refund the postage adjustment to the PC Postage provider or permit the PC Postage provider to submit a reconciliation to the Postal Service. The PC Postage provider must immediately upon receiving notice of the overpayment from the Postal Service, notify the customer and, consistent with the Postal Service's instructions, adjust the funds available to the customer in the Postage Evidencing System, refund the postage adjustment to the customer, or provide a credit to the customer. If the PC Postage provider is unable to comply with the above requirements within 2 business days, the PC Postage provider must immediately notify the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>(C) The <I>collection period</I> is a time period to be set by the Postal Service not to exceed 60 calendar days after initial notification by the Postal Service, subject to any applicable notification periods and dispute mechanisms that may be available to customers for these corrections. If an underpayment has not been satisfied within this collection period, the PC Postage provider shall adjust any funds available to the customer in the Postage Evidencing System to satisfy the postage adjustment to the greatest extent possible, and assist the Postal Service in its efforts to pursue any remedies that may be available in law or equity, including seeking payment directly from the customer.
</P>
<P>(iv)(A) In the case of an underpayment that exceeds the threshold amount, immediately upon receiving notice of the underpayment from the Postal Service the PC Postage provider shall prohibit the customer from printing additional postage labels until the postage adjustment is satisfied in accordance with paragraph (i)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, or the customer disputes the adjustment and prevails. The Postal Service may, in its discretion, waive or delay this prohibition in specific instances.
</P>
<P>(B) Separately, without regard to any threshold, in certain cases (such as where a customer is suspected of having intentionally or repeatedly underpaid postage) the Postal Service may, in its discretion, instruct the PC Postage provider to shut down temporarily or permanently a customer's ability to print PC Postage, and the PC Postage provider shall promptly comply with such instruction.
</P>
<P>(C) In no event shall the Postal Service be liable to any PC Postage provider, customer or other party for any direct, indirect, exemplary, special, consequential, or punitive damages (including without limitation damages relating to loss of profit or business interruption) arising from or related to any customer's permanent or temporary inability to print postage labels in accordance with this paragraph (i)(2)(iv) or as a result of funds offset in accordance with this paragraph.
</P>
<P>(v) The Postal Service, in its discretion, may adopt and modify from time to time, and the PC Postage providers shall comply with, business rules setting forth processes (including time constraints) for payments, refunds, account suspensions, collections, notifications, dispute resolutions and other activities to be performed hereunder. Such business rules will be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.
</P>
<P>(3)(i) Without regard to any threshold, if the PC Postage provider incorrectly programmed postage rates, delayed programming postage rate changes, or otherwise provided systems or software which caused customers to pay incorrect postage amounts, then within two calendar weeks of the PC Postage provider being made aware of such error, the PC Postage provider shall:
</P>
<P>(A) Correct the programming error;
</P>
<P>(B) Provide the Postal Service with a detailed breakdown of how the error affected the PC Postage provider's collection of revenue; and
</P>
<P>(C) Pay the Postal Service for the postage deficiency caused by the programming error, except in instances where the error was caused by the Postal Service or as a direct result of incorrect specifications provided by the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>(4) The PC Postage provider is responsible for ensuring that:
</P>
<P>(i) All customers pay (and the Postal Service receives) the current published prices that are available to customers who purchase postage through an approved PC Postage provider, or negotiated contracted prices where applicable in accordance with this paragraph; and
</P>
<P>(ii) All payments to the Postal Service (or the log files necessary for the Postal Service to collect payments directly from customers) are complete and accurate and are initiated or transmitted, as applicable, to the Postal Service each day.
</P>
<P>(5) Each PC Postage provider shall:
</P>
<P>(i) Before each customer's first transaction following the implementation date of August 1, 2017, provide notice to such customer of the terms, conditions and processes described in this paragraph—including, without limitation, that the customer may be charged for deficient payments and prevented from printing additional postage labels while a postage adjustment remains unpaid—and obtain a certification from each customer that the customer has read, understands and agrees to such terms, conditions and processes, as they may be amended or supplemented from time to time;
</P>
<P>(ii) Ensure that each customer certifies that it:
</P>
<P>(A) Will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to Postal Service services, including, without limitation, the provisions of the Domestic Mail Manual and the International Mail Manual,
</P>
<P>(B) Does not owe any money to the Postal Service and is not a controlling member or officer of an entity that owes money to the Postal Service, and
</P>
<P>(C) Authorizes the PC Postage provider to disclose the customer's personal information to the Postal Service, and such other information retained by the PC Postage provider that may enable the Postal Service to collect debts owed to it, and has the proper authority to disclose such information;
</P>
<P>(iii) Maintain a complete and accurate record for each customer, which includes such customer's current name and a valid U.S. address that is sufficient for service of process under the law, as well as a copy of all terms agreed to by the customer and the date of such agreements;
</P>
<P>(iv) Comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines and ensure that its Postage Evidencing Systems, software, interfaces, communications and other properties that are used to sell or market Postal Service products accurately describe such products;
</P>
<P>(v) Cover any costs or damages that the Postal Service may incur as a result of such PC Postage provider or its employees, contractors, or representatives failing to comply with the terms of this section, or any applicable law, regulation, rule, or government policy; and
</P>
<P>(vi) In performing its obligations hereunder, comply with the business rules that shall be published in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E> from time to time and provide all agreed-upon interface documentation (as updated from time to time).
</P>
<P>(6) In the event that the Postal Service fails to exercise or delays exercising any right, remedy, or privilege under this paragraph, such failure or delay shall not operate as a waiver thereof or of any other provision hereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, or privilege preclude any further exercise of the same. The rights and remedies available to the Postal Service under this paragraph are cumulative and in addition to, and do not diminish, any rights or remedies otherwise available to the Postal Service.

</P>
<P>(3) The proposal must describe the cause and the purposes for which the funds would be used.
</P>
<P>(4) The proposal must demonstrate that the cause to be funded has broad national appeal, and that the cause is in the national public interest and furthers human welfare.

<P>(a) Postal Service policy is to recover from the differential revenue for each semipostal stamp those costs that are determined to be attributable to the semipostal stamp and that would not normally be incurred for stamps having similar sales; physical characteristics; and marketing, promotional, and public relations activities (hereinafter “comparable stamps”).
</P>
<P>(b) Overall responsibility for tracking costs associated with semipostal stamps will rest with the Office of Accounting, Finance, Controller. Individual organizational units incurring costs will provide supporting documentation to the Office of Accounting, Finance, Controller. 
</P>
<P>(c) For each semipostal stamp, the Office of Stamp Services, in coordination with the Office of Accounting, Finance, Controller, shall, based on judgment and available information, identify the comparable stamp(s) and create a profile of the typical cost characteristics of the comparable stamp(s) (<I>e.g.,</I> manufacturing process, gum type), thereby establishing a baseline for cost comparison purposes. The determination of comparable stamps may change during or after the sales period, and different comparable stamp(s) may be used for specific cost comparisons.
</P>
<P>(d) Except as specified, all costs associated with semipostal stamps will be tracked by the Office of Accounting, Finance, Controller. Costs that will not be tracked include:
</P>
<P>(1) Costs that the Postal Service determines to be inconsequentially small, which include those cost items which are less than $3,000 per invoice and are not specifically charged to a semipostal finance number.
</P>
<P>(2) Costs for which the cost of tracking or estimation would be burdensome (<I>e.g.,</I> costs for which the cost of tracking exceeds the cost to be tracked);
</P>
<P>(3) Costs attributable to mail to which semipostal stamps are affixed (which are attributable to the appropriate class and/or subclass of mail); and
</P>
<P>(4) Administrative and support costs that the Postal Service would have incurred whether or not the Semipostal Stamp Program had been established.
</P>
<P>(e) Cost items recoverable from the differential revenue include, but are not limited to, the following:
</P>
<P>(1) Packaging costs in excess of the cost to package comparable stamps;
</P>
<P>(2) Printing costs of flyers and special receipts;
</P>
<P>(3) Costs of changes to equipment;
</P>
<P>(4) Costs of developing and executing marketing and promotional plans in excess of the cost for comparable stamps;
</P>
<P>(5) Other costs specific to the semipostal stamp that would not normally have been incurred for comparable stamps; and
</P>
<P>(6) Costs in paragraph (g) of this section that materially exceed those that would normally have been incurred for comparable stamps.
</P>
<P>(f) The Semipostal Stamp Program incorporates the following provisions that are intended to maximize differential revenues available to the selected causes. These include, but are not limited to, the following: 
</P>
<P>(1) Avoiding, to the extent practicable, promotional costs that exceed those of comparable stamps; 
</P>
<P>(2) Establishing restrictions on the number of concurrently issued semipostal stamps; and 
</P>
<P>(3) Making financial and retail system changes in conjunction with regularly scheduled revisions. 
</P>
<P>(g) Other costs attributable to semipostals but which would normally be incurred for comparable stamps would be recovered through the postage component of the semipostal stamp price. Such costs are not recovered, unless they materially exceed the costs of comparable stamps. These include, but are not limited to, the following:

<P>(1) Costs of stamp design (including market research);
</P>

The Postal Service desires to resolve all such matters quickly and inexpensively in keeping with the regulations in this part.

<P>(b) <I>Scope and applicability.</I> This procedure is established as the sole and exclusive means to resolve disagreements under § 601.107 and contests of decisions under § 601.105. This procedure is intended to expeditiously resolve disagreements that are not resolved at the responsible contracting officer level; to reduce litigation expenses, inconvenience, and other costs for all parties; to facilitate successful business relationships with Postal Service suppliers, the supplier community, and other persons; and to develop further the basis for the Postal Service's purchasing decisions and the administrative records concerning those decisions.

The disagreement under § 601.107 or contest of decision under § 601.105 must state the factual circumstances relating to it and the remedy sought. A disagreement under § 601.107 must also state the scope and outcome of the initial disagreement resolution attempt with the contracting officer.

</P>
<P>(1) Disagreements under § 601.107 not resolved with the contracting officer must be lodged with the SDR Official within 20 days after they were lodged with the contracting officer (unless ADR had been used to attempt to resolve them);
</P>
<P>(2) Disagreements under § 601.107 for which ADR had been agreed to be used must be lodged with the SDR Official within 10 days after the supplier knew or was informed by the contracting officer or otherwise that the matter was not resolved;
</P>
<P>(3) Where a supplier is dissatisfied with the contracting officer's resolution of a disagreement under § 601.107, the supplier must lodge the disagreement with the SDR Official within 10 days after the supplier first receives notification of the contracting officer's resolution; and
</P>
<P>(4) Contests of decisions under § 601.105 to decline to accept or consider proposals must be lodged with the SDR Official within 10 days of the supplier's receipt of the written notice explaining the decision.
</P>
<P>(5) The SDR Official may grant an extension of time to lodge a disagreement under § 601.107 or contest of decision under § 601.105 or to provide supporting information when warranted. Any request for an extension must set forth the reasons for the request, be made in writing, and be delivered to the SDR Official on or before the time to lodge a disagreement lapses.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Disagreement decision process.</I> The SDR Official will promptly provide a copy of a disagreement to the contracting officer, who will promptly notify other interested parties. The SDR Official will consider a disagreement and any response by other interested parties and appropriate Postal Service officials within a time frame established by the SDR Official. The SDR Official may also meet individually or jointly with the person or organization lodging the disagreement, other interested parties, and/or Postal Service officials, and may undertake other activities in order to obtain materials, information, or advice that may help to resolve the disagreement. The person or organization lodging the disagreement, other interested parties, or Postal Service officials must promptly provide all relevant, nonprivileged materials and other information requested by the SDR Official. If a submission contains trade secrets or other confidential information, it should be accompanied by a copy of the submission from which the confidential matter has been redacted. The SDR Official will determine whether any redactions are appropriate and will be solely responsible for determining the treatment of any redacted materials. After obtaining such information, materials, and advice as may be needed, the SDR Official will promptly issue a written decision resolving the disagreement and will deliver the decision to the person or organization lodging the disagreement, other interested parties, and appropriate Postal Service officials. When resolving a disagreement raised under § 601.107, the SDR Official may grant remedies including, but not limited to, the following:
</P>
<P>(1) Directing the contracting officer to revise the solicitation or to issue a new solicitation;
</P>
<P>(2) Directing the contracting officer to recompete the requirement;
</P>
<P>(3) Directing the contracting officer to reevaluate the award on the basis of current proposals and the evaluation factors contained in the solicitation; and
</P>
<P>(4) Directing the contracting officer to terminate the contract or to refrain from exercising options under the contract.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Guidance.</I> The SDR Official will be guided by the regulations contained in this part and all applicable public laws enacted by Congress. Non-Postal Service procurement rules or regulations and revoked Postal Service regulations will not apply or be taken into account. Failure of any party to provide requested information may be taken into account by the SDR Official in the decision.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Final resolution by the SDR Official and final contract award of the Postal Service.</I> A resolution by the SDR Official will be final and binding. If the SDR Official's final resolution affirms the original contract award of the contracting officer, the contracting officer's original contract award becomes the Postal Service's final contract award, and may be subject to judicial review as described in paragraph (h) of this section. If the SDR Official's final resolution directs that the Postal Service terminate the contract award and issue a new solicitation, recompete the requirement, or reevaluate the current award, the contracting officer shall implement promptly the SDR Official's final resolution. However, any contract award made by the contracting officer after a resolicitation, recompetition, or reevaluation directed by the SDR Official is not a final contract award of the Postal Service that may be subject to judicial review unless and until disagreements concerning that contract award have been lodged and resolved with finality by the SDR Official.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Judicial review.</I> The Postal Service's final contract award, as described in paragraph § 601.108(g), may be appealed to a Federal court with jurisdiction based only upon an alleged violation of the regulations contained in this part or an applicable public law enacted by Congress. The party lodging the disagreement may seek review of the Postal Service's final contract award only after the mandatory administrative remedies provided under § 601.107 and § 601.108 have been exhausted.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Resolution timeframe.</I> It is intended that this procedure generally will resolve disagreements under § 601.107 or contests of decisions under § 601.105 within approximately 30 days after receipt by the SDR Official. The time may be shortened or lengthened depending on the complexity of the issues and other relevant considerations.

<HEAD>§ 601.109   Contract claims and disputes.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> This section implements the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, as amended (41 U.S.C. 7101-7109). If ADR is used, the SDR official may serve as a mediator for contract performance disagreements prior to bringing a contract claim or dispute under this part.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Policy.</I> It is the Postal Service's intent to resolve contractual claims and disputes by mutual agreement at the level of an authorized contracting officer whenever possible. In addition, the Postal Service supports and encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution as an effective way to understand, address, and resolve conflicts with suppliers. Efforts to resolve differences should be made before the issuance of a final decision on a claim, and even when the supplier does not agree to use ADR, the contracting officer should consider holding informal discussions between the parties in order to resolve the conflict before the issuance of a final decision.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Supplier claim initiation.</I> Supplier claims must be submitted in writing to the contracting officer for final decision. The contracting officer must document the contract file with evidence of the date of receipt of any submission that the contracting officer determines is a claim. Supplier claims must be submitted within 6 years after accrual of a claim unless the parties agreed to a shorter time period. The 6-year time period does not apply to contracts awarded prior to October 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Postal Service claim initiation.</I> The contracting officer must issue a written decision on any Postal Service claim against a supplier, within six years after accrual of a claim, unless the parties agreed in writing to a shorter time period. The 6-year time period does not apply to contracts awarded prior to October 1, 1995, or to a Postal Service claim based on a supplier claim involving fraud.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Certified claims.</I> Each supplier claim exceeding $100,000 must be accompanied by a certification in accordance with the supplier's contract.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Misrepresentation or fraud.</I> When the contracting officer determines that the supplier is unable to support any part of the claim and there is evidence or reason to believe the inability is attributable to either misrepresentation of fact or fraud on the supplier's part, the contracting officer must deny that part of the claim and refer the matter to the Office of Inspector General.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Decision and appeal</I>—(1) <I>Contracting officer's authority.</I> A contracting officer is authorized to decide or settle all claims arising under or relating to a contract subject to the Contract Disputes Act, except for:
</P>
<P>(i) Claims or disputes for penalties or forfeitures prescribed by statutes or regulation that a Federal agency administers; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Claims involving fraud.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Contracting officer's decision.</I> The contracting officer must review the facts pertinent to the claim, and may obtain assistance from assigned counsel and other advisors, and issue a final decision in writing. The decision must include a description of the claim or dispute with references to the pertinent contract provisions, a statement of the factual areas of agreement and disagreement, and a statement of the contracting officer's decision with supporting rationale.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Insufficient information.</I> When the contracting officer cannot issue a decision because the supplier has not provided sufficient information, the contracting officer may request the required information. Further failure to provide the requested information is an adequate reason to deny the claim.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Furnishing Decisions.</I> The contracting officer must furnish a copy of the decision to the supplier by Certified Mail 
<SU>TM</SU>, return receipt requested, or by any other method that provides evidence of receipt.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Decisions on claims for $100,000 or less.</I> If the supplier has asked for a decision within sixty days, the contracting officer must issue a final decision on a claim of $100,000 or less within sixty calendar days of its receipt. The supplier may consider the contracting officer's failure to issue a decision within the applicable time period as a denial of its claim, and may file a suit or appeal on the claim.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Decisions on certified claims.</I> For certified claims over $100,000, the contracting officer must either issue a final decision within sixty days of their receipt or notify the supplier within the 60-day period of the time when a decision will be issued. The time period established must be reasonable, taking into account the size and complexity of the claim, the adequacy of the supplier's supporting data, and any other relevant factors.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Wording of decisions.</I> The contracting officer's final decision must contain the following paragraph: “This is the final decision of the contracting officer pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 and the clause of your contract entitled <I>Claims and Disputes.</I> You may appeal this decision to the Postal Service Board of Contract Appeals by filing a notice of appeal within ninety days from the date you receive this decision. You may file the notice of appeal online through the USPS Judicial Officer Department's Electronic Filing System Web site located at <I>https://uspsjoe.justware.com/JusticeWeb,</I> or by mailing or otherwise furnishing the notice of appeal to the Postal Service Board of Contract Appeals. You also may appeal by mailing, or otherwise furnishing written notice of appeal to the contracting officer within ninety days from the date you receive this decision. The notice should identify the contract by number, reference this decision, and indicate that an appeal is intended. Alternatively, you may bring an action directly in the United States Court of Federal Claims within twelve months from the date you receive this decision.”
</P>
<P>(8) <I>Additional wording for decisions of $50,000 or less.</I> When the claim or claims denied total $50,000 or less, the contracting officer must add the following to the paragraph: “In taking an appeal to the Board of Contract Appeals, you may include in your notice of appeal an election to proceed under the Board's small claims (expedited) procedure, which provides for a decision within approximately 120 days, or an election to proceed under the Board's accelerated procedure, which provides for a decision within approximately 180 days. If you do not make an election in the notice of appeal, you may do so by written notice anytime thereafter.”
</P>
<P>(9) <I>Additional wording for decisions over $50,000 up to $100,000.</I> When the claim or claims denied total $100,000 or less, but more than $50,000, the contracting officer must add the following to the paragraph: “In taking an appeal to the Board of Contract Appeals, you may include in your notice of appeal an election to proceed under the Board's accelerated procedure, which provides for a decision within approximately 180 days. If you do not make an election in the notice of appeal, you may do so by written notice anytime thereafter.”
</P>
<P>(10) <I>Information and resources.</I> Contracting officers must have sufficient information available at the time a final decision is issued on a claim so resolution of an appeal within the period set for an expedited disposition will not be delayed. Once an appeal is docketed, and expedited disposition is elected, contracting officers must devote sufficient resources to the appeal to ensure the schedule for resolution is met. Nothing in this part precludes an effort by the parties to settle a controversy after an appeal has been filed, although such efforts to settle the controversy will not suspend processing the appeal, unless the Board of Contract Appeals so directs.

<HEAD>§ 601.113   Suspension, debarment, and ineligibility.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> Except as provided otherwise in this part, contracting officers may not solicit proposals from, award contracts to, or, when a contract provides for such consent, consent to subcontracts with suspended, debarred, or ineligible suppliers.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Definitions.</I>—(1) <I>Affiliate.</I> A business, organization, person, or individual connected by the fact that one controls or has the power to control the other or by the fact that a third party controls or has the power to control both. Indications of control include, but are not limited to, interlocking management or ownership, identity of interests among family members, shared facilities and equipment, contractual relationships, common use of employees, or a business entity organized following the suspension, debarment, or proposed debarment of a supplier which has the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees as the supplier that was suspended, debarred, or proposed for debarment. Franchise agreements are not conclusive evidence of affiliation if the franchisee has a right to profit in proportion to its ownership and bears the risk of loss or failure.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Debarment.</I> An exclusion from contracting and subcontracting for a reasonable, specified period of time commensurate with the seriousness of the offense, failure, or inadequacy of performance.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>General Counsel.</I> This includes the General Counsel's authorized representative.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Indictment.</I> Indictment for a criminal offense. An information or other filing by competent authority charging a criminal offense is given the same effect as an indictment.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Ineligible.</I> An exclusion from contracting and subcontracting by an entity other than the Postal Service under statutes, executive orders, or regulations, such as the Davis-Bacon Act, the Service Contract Act, the Equal Employment Opportunity Acts, the Walsh-Healy Public Contracts Act, or the Environmental Protection Acts and related regulations or executive orders, to which the Postal Service is subject or has adopted as a matter of policy.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Suspension.</I> An exclusion from contracting and subcontracting for a reasonable period of time due to specified reasons or the pendency of a debarment proceeding.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Supplier.</I> For the purposes of this part, a supplier is any individual, person, or other legal entity that:
</P>
<P>(i) Directly or indirectly (e.g., through an affiliate) submits offers for, is awarded, or reasonably may be expected to submit offers for or be awarded, a Postal Service contract, including a contract for carriage under Postal Service or commercial bills of lading, or a subcontract under a Postal Service contract; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Conducts business or reasonably may be expected to conduct business with the Postal Service as a subcontractor, an agent, or as a representative of another supplier.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Suspension, debarment, and ineligible list.</I> (1) The Postal Service uses the General Services Administration's System for Award Management (SAM) to determine if suppliers are suspended, debarred, or proposed for debarment.
</P>
<P>(2) SAM maintains a consolidated database of all persons and entities suspended, debarred, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible by Federal agencies or the Government Accountability Office. SAM is accessible by the public on GSA's Web site at <I>https://www.sam.gov.</I>
</P>
<P>(3) Through a representative, the vice president, Supply Management will use the SAM Exclusions database to report Postal Service suspensions, debarments and proposed debarment decisions; including changes in the status of suppliers and any of their affiliates. Inquiries concerning listed suppliers should be directed to the agency or other authority that took the action.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Treatment of suppliers included in the SAM Exclusions database.</I> (1) Contracting officers will review the SAM Exclusions database before making a contract award.
</P>
<P>(2) Suppliers included in the SAM Exclusions database are excluded from receiving contracts and subcontracts, and contracting officers may not solicit proposals or quotations from, award contracts to, or, when a contract provides for such consent, consent to subcontracts with such suppliers, unless the vice president, Supply Management, or his or her designee, after consultation with the General Counsel, has approved such action.
</P>
<P>(3) Suppliers included in the SAM Exclusions database may not provide goods or services to other persons or entities for resale, in whole or part, to the Postal Service and such other persons or entities are obligated to review the consolidated GSA list in order to exclude suppliers suspended or debarred by the Postal Service from performing any part of a Postal Service contract.
</P>
<P>(4) The suspension, debarment, or ineligibility of a supplier does not, of itself, affect the rights and obligations of the parties to any valid, pre-existing contract. The Postal Service may terminate for default a contract with a supplier that is suspended, debarred, or determined to be ineligible. Contracting officers may not add new work to any contract with a supplier that is suspended, debarred, or determined to be ineligible by supplemental agreement, by exercise of an option, or otherwise (unless the work is classified as an insignificant or significant minor service change to a mail transportation contract), except with the approval of the vice president, Supply Management, or designee after consultation with the General Counsel.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Causes for suspension.</I> (1) The vice president, Supply Management, may suspend any supplier, including any of its affiliates, for causes such as the following:
</P>
<P>(i) If the supplier commits, is indicted for, or is convicted of fraud or a criminal offense incidental to obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a government contract, violates a Federal antitrust statute arising out of the submission of bids and proposals, or commits or engages in embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, or receipt of stolen property, or any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty;
</P>
<P>(ii) For any other cause of such serious and compelling nature that suspension is warranted; or
</P>
<P>(iii) If the Postal Service has notified a supplier of its proposed debarment under this part.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Period of suspension.</I> A suspension will not exceed one year in duration, except a suspension may be extended for reasonable periods of time beyond one year by the vice president, Supply Management. The termination of a suspension will not prejudice the Postal Service's position in any debarment proceeding. A suspension will be superseded by a decision rendered by the vice president, Supply Management, under paragraph (k)(5) of this section.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Procedural requirements for suspension.</I> (1) The vice president, Supply Management will notify a supplier of a suspension or an extension of a suspension and the reason(s) for the suspension or extension in writing sent to the supplier by Certified Mail, return receipt requested, within ten days after the effective date of the suspension or extension. A copy of the notice will be furnished to the Office of the Inspector General.
</P>
<P>(2) The notice will state the cause(s) for the suspension or extension.
</P>
<P>(3) Within thirty days of notice of suspension or an extension, a supplier may submit to the vice president, Supply Management, in writing, any information or reason(s) the supplier believes makes a suspension or an extension inappropriate, and the vice president, Supply Management, in consultation with the General Counsel, will consider the supplier's submission, and, in their discretion, may revoke a suspension or an extension of a suspension. If a suspension or extension is revoked, the revocation will be in writing and a copy of the revocation will be sent to the supplier by Certified Mail, return receipt requested. A copy of the revocation will be furnished to the Office of the Inspector General.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Causes for debarment.</I> (1) The vice president, Supply Management, with the concurrence of the General Counsel, may debar a supplier, including its affiliates, for cause such as the following:
</P>
<P>(i) Conviction of a criminal offense incidental to obtaining or attempting to obtain contracts or subcontracts, or in the performance of a contract or subcontract.
</P>
<P>(ii) Conviction under a Federal antitrust statute arising out of the submission of bids or proposals.
</P>
<P>(iii) Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, or receiving stolen property.
</P>
<P>(iv) Violation of a Postal Service contract so serious as to justify debarment, such as willful failure to perform a Postal Service contract in accordance with the specifications or within the time limit(s) provided in the contract; a record of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory performance in accordance with the terms of one or more Postal Service contracts occurring within a reasonable period of time preceding the determination to debar (except that failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance caused by acts beyond the control of the supplier may not be considered a basis for debarment); violation of a contractual provision against contingent fees; or acceptance of a contingent fee paid in violation of a contractual provision against contingent fees.
</P>
<P>(v) Any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty.
</P>
<P>(vi) Any other cause of a serious and compelling nature that debarment is warranted.
</P>
<P>(2) The existence of a conviction in paragraph (h)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section can be established by proof of a conviction in a court of competent jurisdiction. If an appeal taken from such conviction results in a reversal of the conviction, the debarment may be removed upon the request of the supplier, unless another cause or another basis for debarment exists.
</P>
<P>(3) The existence of any of the other causes in paragraphs (h)(1)(iii), (iv), (v), or (vi) of this section can be established by a preponderance of the evidence, either direct or indirect, in the judgment of the vice president of Supply Management.
</P>
<P>(4) The criminal, fraudulent, or improper conduct of an individual may be imputed to the firm with which he or she is or has been connected when an impropriety was committed. Likewise, when a firm is involved in criminal, fraudulent, or other improper conduct, any person who participated in, knew of, or had reason to know of the impropriety may be debarred.
</P>
<P>(5) The criminal, fraudulent, or other improper conduct of one supplier participating in a joint venture or similar arrangement may be imputed to other participating suppliers if the conduct occurred for or on behalf of the joint venture or similar arrangement, or with the knowledge, approval, or acquiescence of the supplier. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct will be evidence of such knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Mitigating factors.</I> (1) The existence of any cause for debarment does not necessarily require that a supplier be debarred. The decision to debar is within the discretion of the vice president, Supply Management, with the concurrence of the General Counsel, and must be made in the best interest of the Postal Service. The following factors may be assessed in determining the seriousness of the offense, failure, or inadequacy of performance, and may be taken into account in deciding whether debarment is warranted:
</P>
<P>(i) Whether the supplier had established written standards of conduct and had published internal control systems at the time of the activity that constitutes cause for debarment or had adopted such procedures prior to any Postal Service investigation of the activity cited as a cause for debarment.
</P>
<P>(ii) Whether the supplier brought the activity cited as a cause for debarment to the attention of the Postal Service in a prompt, timely manner.
</P>
<P>(iii) Whether the supplier promptly and fully investigated the circumstances involving debarment and, if so, made the full results of the investigation available to appropriate officials of the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>(iv) Whether the supplier cooperated fully with the Postal Service during its investigation into the matter.
</P>
<P>(v) Whether the supplier paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and administrative liability, and other costs arising out of the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the Postal Service, and made or agreed to make full restitution.
</P>
<P>(vi) Whether the supplier took appropriate disciplinary action against the individual(s) responsible for the activity that could cause debarment.
</P>
<P>(vii) Whether the supplier implemented and/or agreed to implement remedial measures, including those identified by the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>(viii) Whether the supplier instituted and/or agreed to institute new and/or revised review and control procedures and ethics programs.
</P>
<P>(ix) Whether the supplier had adequate time to eliminate circumstances within the supplier's organization that could lead to debarment.
</P>
<P>(x) Whether the supplier's senior officers and mid-level management recognize and understand the seriousness of the misconduct giving rise to debarment.
</P>
<P>(2) The existence or nonexistence of mitigating factors or remedial measures such as those above is not determinative whether or not a supplier should be debarred. If a cause for debarment exists, the supplier has the burden of demonstrating, to the satisfaction of the vice president, Supply Management that debarment is not warranted or necessary.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Period of debarment.</I> (1) When an applicable statute, executive order, or controlling regulation of other agencies provides a specific period of debarment, that period applies. In other cases, debarment by the Postal Service should be for a reasonable, definite, stated period of time, commensurate with the seriousness of the offense or the failure or inadequacy of performance. Generally, a period of debarment should not exceed three years. When debarment for an additional period is deemed necessary, notice of the proposed additional period of debarment must be furnished to the supplier as in the case of original debarment.
</P>
<P>(2) Except as precluded by an applicable statute, executive order, or controlling regulation of another agency, debarment may be removed or the period may be reduced by the vice president, Supply Management when requested by the debarred supplier and when the request is supported by a reasonable justification, such as newly discovered material evidence, reversal of a conviction, bona fide change of ownership or management, or the elimination of the causes for which debarment was imposed. The vice president, Supply Management may, at his or her discretion, deny any request or refer it to the Judicial Officer for a hearing and for findings of fact, which the vice president, Supply Management will consider when deciding the matter. When a debarment is removed or the debarment period is reduced, the vice president, Supply Management must state in writing the reason(s) for the removal of the debarment or the reduction of the period of debarment.
</P>
<P>(k) <I>Procedural requirements for debarment.</I> (1) After securing the concurrence of the General Counsel, the vice president, Supply Management will initiate a debarment proceeding by sending the supplier a written notice of proposed debarment. The notice will be served by sending it to the last known address of the supplier by Certified Mail, return receipt requested. A copy of the notice will be furnished to the Office of Inspector General. The notice will state that debarment is being considered; the reason(s) for the proposed debarment; the anticipated period of debarment and the proposed effective date; and that, within thirty days of the notice, the supplier, individually or through a representative, may submit in person or in writing information and argument in opposition to the proposed debarment. In the event a supplier does not submit information or argument in opposition to the proposed debarment to the vice president, Supply Management within the time allowed, the debarment will become final with no further review or appeal.
</P>
<P>(2) If the proposed debarment is based on a conviction or civil judgment, the vice president, Supply Management, with the concurrence of the General Counsel, may decide whether debarment is merited based on the conviction or judgment, including any information received from the supplier. If the debarment is based on other circumstances or if there are questions regarding material facts, the vice president, Supply Management may seek additional information from the supplier and/or other persons, and may request the Judicial Officer to hold a fact-finding hearing on such matters. The hearing will be governed by rules of procedure promulgated by the Judicial Officer. The vice president, Supply Management may reject any findings of fact, in whole or in part, when they are clearly erroneous.
</P>
<P>(3) Questions of fact to be resolved by a hearing before the Judicial Officer will be based on the preponderance of the evidence.
</P>
<P>(4) After consideration of the circumstances and any information and argument submitted by the supplier, the vice president, Supply Management, with the concurrence of the General Counsel, will issue a written decision regarding whether the supplier is debarred, and, if so, for the period of debarment. The decision will be mailed to the supplier by Certified Mail, return receipt requested. A copy of the decision will be furnished to the Office of the Inspector General. The decision will be final and binding, unless the decision was procured by fraud or other criminal misconduct, or the decision was obtained in violation of the regulations contained in this part or an applicable public law enacted by Congress.

The making of such an entry in the records of a Reserve bank shall (1) have the effect of a delivery in bearer form of definitive Postal Service securities; (2) have the effect of a taking of delivery by the transferee or pledgee; (3) constitute the transferee or pledgee a holder; and (4) if a pledge, effect a perfected security interest therein in favor of the pledgee.

<P>(b) A transfer or a pledge of transferable Postal Service securities, or any interest therein, which is maintained by a Reserve bank (in its individual capacity or as fiscal agent of the United States) in a book-entry account under this part, including securities in book-entry form under § 761.3(a)(3), is effected, and a pledge is perfected, by any means that would be effective under applicable law to effect a transfer or to effect and perfect a pledge of the Postal Service securities, or any interest therein, if the securities were maintained by the Reserve bank in bearer definitive form. For purposes of transfer or pledge hereunder, book-entry Postal Service securities maintained by a Reserve bank shall, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, be deemed to be maintained in bearer definitive form.

A Reserve bank will not accept notice or advice of a transfer or pledge effected or perfected under this paragraph, and any such notice or advice shall have no effect. A Reserve bank may continue to deal with its depositor in accordance with the provisions of this part, notwithstanding any transfer or pledge effected or perfected under this paragraph.

<HEAD>§ 775.9   Environmental evaluation process.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>All actions</I>—(1) <I>Assessment of actions.</I> An environmental checklist may be used to support a record of environmental consideration as the determination that the proposed action does not require an environmental assessment. An environmental assessment must be prepared for each proposed action except that an assessment need not be made if a determination is made that:
</P>
<P>(i) The action is one of a class listed in § 775.6, Categorical Exclusions, and
</P>
<P>(ii) The action is not affected by extraordinary circumstances which may cause it to have a significant environmental effect, or
</P>
<P>(iii) The action is a type that is not a major federal action with a significant impact upon the environment.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Findings of no significant impact.</I> If an environmental assessment indicates that there is no significant impact of a proposed action on the environment, an environmental impact statement is not required. A “finding of no significant impact” (FONSI) is prepared and published in accordance with § 775.13. When the proposed action is approved, it may be accomplished without further environmental consideration. A FONSI document briefly presents the reasons why an action will not have a significant effect on the human environment and states that an environmental impact statement will not be prepared. It must refer to the environmental assessment and any other environmentally pertinent documents related to it. The assessment may be included in the finding if it is short, in which case the discussion in the assessment need not be repeated in the finding. The FONSI may be a mitigated FONSI in which case the required mitigation factors should be listed in the FONSI. The use of a mitigated FONSI is conditioned upon the implementation of the identified mitigation measures in the EA that support the FONSI. Unless the mitigation measures are implemented by the responsible official, the use of an EA in lieu of an EIS is not acceptable.
</P>
<P>(3) Impact statement preparation decision and notices. If an environmental assessment indicates that a proposed major action would have a significant impact on the environment, a notice of intent to prepare an impact statement is published (see § 775.13) and an environmental impact statement is prepared.
</P>
<P>(4) Role of impact statement in decision making. An environmental impact statement is used, with other analyses and materials, to decide which alternative should be pursued, or whether a proposed action should be abandoned or other courses of action pursued. See § 775.12 for restrictions on the timing of this decision.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Record of decision.</I> For actions requiring environmental impact statements, a concise public record of decision is prepared when a decision, or a proposal for legislation, is made. The record, which may be integrated into any other record, or notice, including that required by Postal Service regulations and procedures governing intergovernmental review of Postal Service facility project actions, must:
</P>
<P>(i) State what the decision was. 
</P>
<P>(ii) Identify all alternatives considered in reaching a decision, specifying alternatives considered to be environmentally preferable; identify and discuss all significant factors, including any essential considerations of national policy, which were weighed in making the decision and state how those considerations entered into the decision. 
</P>
<P>(iii) State whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the alternative selected have been or will be adopted, and if not, why not. 
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Actions prohibited prior to issuance of record of decision.</I> Until a record of decision is issued, no action may be taken on a proposal on which an environmental impact statement is made if the action would: 
</P>
<P>(i) Have an adverse environmental impact, or 
</P>
<P>(ii) Limit the choice of reasonable alternatives. 
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Mitigation measures.</I> Practicable mitigation measures identified in an environmental assessment must be implemented. Mitigation measures described in an environmental impact statement and accepted in a decision must be implemented. Upon request, the Postal Service informs federal, state, and local agencies and the public of the progress in carrying out adopted mitigation measures. 
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Additional requirements for facility actions.</I> (1) The environmental assessment of any action which involves the construction or acquisition of a new mail processing facility must include reasonable alternatives to the proposed action and not just consideration of contending sites for a facility. This process must be started early in the planning of the action. An environmental assessment report, however, is not required until the contending project sites have been determined. The information contained in the environmental assessment report must be used, together with other site planning information, in the selection of the final site.
</P>
<P>(2) When an environmental assessment indicates that an environmental impact statement may be needed for a proposed facility action, the responsible officer will make the decision whether to prepare an environmental impact statement for presentation to the Capital Investment Committee, and to the Board of Governors if the Board considers the proposal.
</P>
<P>(3) If an environmental impact statement is presented to the Committee or the Board, and an analysis indicates that it would be more cost-effective to proceed immediately with continued control of sites, (including advance acquisition, if necessary, and where authorized by postal procedures), environmental impact statement preparation, and project designs, a budgetary request will include authorization of funds to permit:
</P>
<P>(i) The preparation of an impact statement encompassing all reasonable alternatives and site alternatives,
</P>
<P>(ii) The continued control of specified competing sites (including advance acquisition, if necessary, and where authorized by postal procedures), chosen to preserve environmental or other options, and 
</P>
<P>(iii) The development of limited designs of facilities for each competing site.
</P>
<P>(4) A completed environmental impact statement will be presented to the Capital Investment Committee, and to the Board of Governors if the Board considers the proposal, for use in deciding whether a proposed project should proceed, be restudied, or be abandoned. If the decision is to proceed with a proposed project, the Committee, or the Board if it considers the proposal, decides which alternative site is to be used for project development, and authorizes the project.

<HEAD>§ 775.11   Environmental impact statements.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Determining scope.</I> Before an environmental impact statement is prepared, the following procedures must be followed to determine what issues are to be addressed and in what depth:
</P>
<P>(1) Affected Federal, State, and local agencies and other interested persons are invited to participate by furnishing written views and information, or at a hearing if appropriate. Notice is given in accordance with § 775.13.
</P>
<P>(2) The significance of issues to be analyzed in depth in the environmental impact statement is determined through consideration of:
</P>
<P>(i) Actions which are closely related, or similar, or have cumulative significant impacts.
</P>
<P>(ii) Alternatives, which must include the “no action” alternative, other reasonable courses of action, and mitigation measures.
</P>
<P>(iii) Impacts, which may be direct, indirect, or cumulative.
</P>
<P>(3) Issues which are not significant are identified and eliminated.
</P>
<P>(4) The determinations made must be revised if substantial changes are made later in the proposed action, or if significant new circumstances or information arise which bear on the proposal or its impacts.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Preparation.</I> (1) Except for proposals for legislation, environmental impact statements are prepared in two stages:
</P>
<P>(i) Draft environmental impact statement, prepared in accordance with the scope decided upon under paragraph (a) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) Final environmental impact statement, responding to comments on the draft statement and discussing and responding to any responsible opposing view which was not adequately discussed in the draft statement.
</P>
<P>(2) Environmental impact statements must:
</P>
<P>(i) Be analytic rather than encyclopedic.
</P>
<P>(ii) Contain discussions of impacts in proportion to their significance. Insignificant impacts eliminated during the process under § 775.11(a) to determine the scope of issues must be discussed only to the extent necessary to state why they will not be significant.
</P>
<P>(iii) Be concise, and not longer than is necessary to comply with NEPA. They must not contain repeated statements of the same basic points.
</P>
<P>(iv) Contain discussions of alternatives considered and of how alternatives chosen will meet the requirements of NEPA and other environmental laws and policies.
</P>
<P>(v) Encompass the range of alternatives to be considered by the decision makers.
</P>
<P>(vi) Serve to assess the environmental impact of proposed actions, rather than to justify decisions already made.
</P>
<P>(3) The text of final environmental impact statements normally should be less than 150 pages. Statements on proposals of unusual scope or complexity normally should be less than 300 pages.
</P>
<P>(4) Staged or “tiered” environmental impact statements must not contain repetitive discussions of the same issues. Each document must state where each earlier document is available.
</P>
<P>(5) Material may be incorporated into an environmental impact statement by reference only when the material is reasonably available for inspection by potentially interested persons within the time allowed for comment.
</P>
<P>(6) If information relevant to reasonably foreseeable adverse impacts cannot be obtained because the overall cost of obtaining it is exorbitant or the means to obtain it are not known, the fact that such information is incomplete or unavailable must be stated clearly. In addition, the relevance of the incomplete or unavailable information to the evaluation of the impacts must be stated, and a summary of existing credible scientific evidence relevant to evaluation of the impacts must be included, as well as an evaluation of such impacts on the basis of theoretical approaches or generally accepted research methods. For purposes of this subsection, “reasonably foreseeable” includes impacts which have catastrophic consequences, even if their probability of occurrence is low, provided that the analysis of the impacts is supported by credible scientific evidence, is not based on pure conjecture, and is within the rule of reason. 
</P>
<P>(7) If a cost-benefit analysis relevant to the choice among environmentally different alternatives was prepared for the proposed action, it must be incorporated by reference or appended to the statement to aid in evaluating the environmental consequences. The relationship between the cost-benefit analysis and any analysis of unquantified environmental impacts, values, and amenities must be discussed.
</P>
<P>(8) Methods used must be identified, and footnote references must be made to scientific and other sources relied on for conclusions. Analytical techniques may be incorporated in appendices.
</P>
<P>(9) Permits, licenses, and other authorizations needed to implement a proposal must be listed in the draft environmental impact statement and the prospects for obtaining them must be assessed. Where there is uncertainty as to the need for an authorization it must be indicated.
</P>
<P>(10) An environmental impact statement must contain a discussion of any inconsistency between the proposed action and any State or local law, ordinance, or approved plan; and must contain a description of the manner and extent to which the proposed action will be reconciled with the law, ordinance, or approved plan. 
</P>
<P>(11) Where State laws or local ordinances impose environmental impact statement requirements which are not in conflict with those in NEPA, an environmental impact statement made by the Postal Service should satisfy pertinent State and local requirements to the extent practicable. 
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Format.</I> The standard format for environmental statements is: 
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Cover Sheet.</I> The cover sheet, not to exceed one page, must include: 
</P>
<P>(i) A list of the responsible agencies including the lead agency and any cooperating agencies. 
</P>
<P>(ii) The title of the proposed action that is the subject of the statement (and if appropriate, the titles of related cooperating agency actions), together with any city, state, and county where the action is to take place. 
</P>
<P>(iii) The name, address, and telephone number of a person at the agency who can supply further information. 
</P>
<P>(iv) A designation of the document as a draft or final statement or a draft or final supplement. 
</P>
<P>(v) A one-paragraph abstract of the statement. 
</P>
<P>(vi) The date by which comments must be received. 
</P>
<P>(2) Summary. The section should compare and summarize the findings of the analyses of the affected environment, the environmental impacts, the environmental consequences, the alternatives, and the mitigation measures. The summary should sharply define the issues and provide a clear basis for choosing alternatives.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Table of Contents.</I> 
</P>
<P>(4) Proposed action. This section should clearly outline the need for the EIS and the purpose and description of the proposed action. The entire action should be discussed, including connected and similar actions. A clear discussion of the action will assist in consideration of the alternatives.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Alternatives and mitigation.</I> This portion of the environmental impact statement is vitally important. Based on the analysis in the Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences section (see § 775.11(c)(6)), the environmental impacts and the alternatives are presented in comparative form, thus sharply defining the issues and providing a clear basis for choosing alternatives. Those preparing the statement must:
</P>
<P>(i) Explore and evaluate all reasonable alternatives, including the “no action” alternative, and briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating any alternatives. 
</P>
<P>(ii) Devote substantial treatment to each alternative considered in detail, including the proposed action, so that reviewers may evaluate their comparative merits. 
</P>
<P>(iii) Identify the preferred alternative or alternatives in the draft and final statements. 
</P>
<P>(iv) Describe appropriate mitigation measures not considered to be an integral part of the proposed action or alternatives. See § 775.9(a)(7).
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences.</I> For each reasonable alternative, each affected element of the environment must be described, followed immediately by an analysis of the impacts (environmental consequences). The analysis must include, among others, the following: 
</P>
<P>(i) Any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the action be implemented. 
</P>
<P>(ii) The relationship between short-term uses of the environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, 
</P>
<P>(iii) Any irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources should the action be implemented, and 
</P>
<P>(iv) Energy requirements and conservation; and natural, or depletable, resource requirements and conservation. 
</P>
<P>(7) <I>List of Mitigation Measures.</I> 
</P>
<P>(8) <I>List of Preparers.</I> List the names, together with the qualifications (expertise, professional disciplines), of persons who were primarily responsible for preparing the environmental impact statement or significant background papers. 
</P>
<P>(9) <I>List of Agencies, Organizations and Persons to Whom Copies of the Statement Are Sent.</I> 
</P>
<P>(10) <I>Index.</I> 
</P>
<P>(11) <I>Appendices.</I> Include comments on draft statement in final statement. 
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Distribution.</I> (1) Any completed draft environmental impact statement which is made the subject of a public hearing, must be made available to the public as provided in § 775.12, of this chapter at least 15 days in advance of the hearing.
</P>
<P>(2) Draft and final environmental impact statements must be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency. Five copies are filed with EPA's headquarters addressed to the Office of Federal Activities (A-104), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460; five copies are also filed with the responsible EPA region. Statements may not be filed with the EPA earlier than they are transmitted to commenting agencies and made available to the public. 
</P>
<P>(3) Copies of draft and final environmental impact statements must be furnished to: 
</P>
<P>(i) Any Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved. 
</P>
<P>(ii) Any appropriate Federal, state, or local agency authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards. 
</P>
<P>(iii) The appropriate review officials identified in the Postal Service regulations and procedures governing intergovernmental review of Postal Service facility project actions, the State Historic Preservation Officer, and, when National Register or eligible properties may be affected, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. 
</P>
<P>(iv) Any person, organization or agency requesting them. 
</P>
<P>(4) Copies of final environmental impact statements must be furnished to any person who, or organization or agency which, submitted substantive comments on the draft. 
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Responses to comments.</I> (1) A final statement responds to comments on a draft statement in one or more of the following ways: 
</P>
<P>(i) Modification of alternatives, including the proposed action. 
</P>
<P>(ii) Development and evaluation of alternatives not previously given serious consideration. 
</P>
<P>(iii) Supplementation, improvement, or modification of analyses. 
</P>
<P>(iv) Correction of facts. 
</P>
<P>(v) Explanation of why a comment does not warrant a direct response, citing supporting sources, authorities, or reasons. Relevant circumstances which may trigger reappraisal or further response must be indicated. 
</P>
<P>(2) Substantive comments received on a draft statement must be attached to the final statement. 
</P>
<P>(3) If all of the changes are minor and are confined to responses described in paragraphs (e)(1) (iv) and (v) of this section, errata sheets may be written, and only the comments and errata sheets need be recirculated. In such a case, the draft statement with the comments, errata sheets, and a new cover, must be filed as the final statement. 
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Supplements.</I> (1) A supplement to a draft or final environmental impact statement must be issued if: 
</P>
<P>(i) Substantial changes are made in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns; or 
</P>
<P>(ii) Significant new circumstances or information bearing on environmental impacts of the proposed action arise or are discovered. 
</P>
<P>(2) The decision on a proposed action involving an environmental impact statement, must be delayed until any necessary supplement has been circulated and has gone through the commenting period. A supplement is prepared, circulated, and filed in the same manner (except for determining scope) as draft and final statements, unless alternative procedures are approved by CEQ. 
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Contracting.</I> A contractor employed to prepare an environmental impact statement must certify that it has no financial or other interest in the outcome of the project. 
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Proposals for Legislation.</I> Legislative environmental impact statements must be prepared and transmitted as follows: 
</P>
<P>(1) A legislative environmental impact statement is considered part of the formal transmittal of a legislative proposal to the Congress. It may be transmitted to the Congress up to 30 days after the proposal. The statement must be available in time for Congressional hearings and deliberations. 
</P>
<P>(2) Preparation and processing of a legislative statement must conform to the requirements for impact statements, except as follows: 
</P>
<P>(i) It is not necessary to determine the scope of issues. 
</P>
<P>(ii) A draft is considered to be a final statement. Both draft and final statements are needed only when: 
</P>
<P>(A) A Congressional committee with jurisdiction over the proposal has a rule requiring both. 
</P>
<P>(B) Both are specifically required by statute for proposals of the type being submitted. 
</P>
<P>(3) Comments received on a legislative statement, and the Postal Service's responses, must be forwarded to the Congress.

<HEAD>§ 776.5   Review procedures.</HEAD>
<P>Officials shall follow the decision-making process outlined in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, when a facility action may involve floodplain issues. Under certain circumstances, this process may be carried out with fewer steps if all objectives of the decision-making process can be achieved. A general principle underlying this process is that a postal facility action requiring construction in a floodplain may be considered only when there is no practicable alternative.
</P>
<P>(a) <I>Analysis of alternatives.</I> If a postal facility action would involve construction in a floodplain, alternative actions shall be considered.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Early public notice.</I> If a facility action at the contending site(s) could require construction in a floodplain, public notice must be provided.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Floodplain location and information.</I> (1) Personnel shall determine whether construction would occur within a floodplain. The determination shall be made by reference to appropriate Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) floodplain maps (sometimes referred to as Floodplain Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM)), or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) maps, or more detailed maps if available. If such maps are not available, floodplain location must be determined based on the best available information.
</P>
<P>(2) Once the preferred site has been identified, potential floodplain impacts must be determined. As part of this determination process, specific floodplain information should be developed, which is to consider:
</P>
<P>(i) Whether the proposed action will directly or indirectly support floodplain development;
</P>
<P>(ii) Flood hazard and risk to lives and property;
</P>
<P>(iii) Effects on natural and beneficial floodplain values, such as water quality maintenance, groundwater recharge, and agriculture; and
</P>
<P>(iv) Possible measures to minimize harm to, or impact on, the floodplain.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Reevaluation.</I> After the above steps have been followed, if the determination is that there appears to be no practicable alternative to constructing in a floodplain, a further review of alternatives must be conducted by the facilities organization in conjunction with the operations organization requesting the construction of the facility. The further review of alternatives must be conducted by the operations organization for projects within the delegated authority of the Vice President, Area Operations.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Final public notice.</I> As a result of the reevaluation, if it is determined that there is no practicable alternative to constructing in a floodplain, public notice shall be provided as soon as possible for the proposed action. The notice should be publicized and should include:
</P>
<P>(1) Identification of the project's location;
</P>
<P>(2) Provision for a 30-day public commenting period before irrevocable action is taken by the Postal Service; and
</P>
<P>(3) Name and complete address of a postal contact person responsible for providing further information on the decision to proceed with a facility action or construction project in a floodplain. Upon request, that person shall provide further information as follows:
</P>
<P>(i) A description of why the proposed action must be located in a floodplain;
</P>
<P>(ii) A listing of alternative actions considered in making the determination; and
</P>
<P>(iii) A statement indicating whether the action conforms to applicable state and local floodplain protection standards.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Distribution.</I> The above public notice will be sent to appropriate officials, local newspapers, and other parties who express interest in the project.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>NEPA coordination.</I> If either an Environmental Impact Statement or an Environmental Assessment is required under the Postal Service's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations, the above review procedures must be incorporated into and evaluated in that document.

<P>(4) On a site that is typical in size for residential development with normal site improvements including customary landscaping. The site need not include special improvements such as outbuildings, fences, swimming pools, and greenhouses.
</P>
<P>(5) Currently available to the displaced person.
</P>
<P>(6) Within the financial means of the displaced person.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Decent, Safe, and Sanitary Dwelling.</I> A dwelling which meets local housing and occupancy codes and the following standards, unless they are waived for good cause by the Postal Service. The dwelling must:

There shall be a separate, well-lighted and ventilated bathroom that provides privacy to the user and contains a bathtub or shower stall, sink, and toilet, all in good working order and properly connected to appropriate sources of water and to a sewage drainage system. In the case of a housekeeping unit—as opposed to, for example, a room in a boarding house—there shall be a kitchen area that contains a fully usable sink, properly connected to potable hot and cold water and to a sewage draining system, and adequate space and utility service connections for a stove and a refrigerator.
</P>
<P>(5) Contain unobstructed egress to safe, open space at ground level.

(The requirement that the tenant occupy such real property on the date title in such real property transfers to the Postal Service may be waived for good cause by the Postal Service.)
</P>
<P>(C) Where such real property was used to construct a new building for the express purpose of leasing to the Postal Service under circumstances where such tenant would have been a “displaced person” hereunder had the Postal Service itself acquired the land and required the removal of the tenant to undertake construction of the building for Postal Service ownership.
</P>
<P>(iii) Where the Postal Service acquires either a fee interest or a leasehold interest in the property, a person who is a residential tenant and is or will be required to move or to move his or her property from the real property, in order for the Postal Service to accomplish the project for which the property was acquired, provided such tenant occupies such real property on the date title in such real property transfers to the Postal Service or the date the Postal Service leases or contracts to lease such property, and further provided such tenant was lawfully in possession at the time of the initiation of negotiations.

A tenant who was legally required by the lease or otherwise to have moved from the property at the times specified in such paragraphs shall not be considered to be lawfully in possession.
</P>
<P>(iv) A person who, at the determination of the Postal Service, is not required to relocate permanently, or,
</P>
<P>(v) A person who, after receiving a notice of displacement or notice to vacate by the Postal Service, is notified in writing that he or she will not be displaced. Such later notification shall not be issued if the person has already moved. If such latter notification is issued, the Postal Service shall reimburse the person for any reasonable expenses incurred to satisfy any binding contractual relocation obligations entered into after the effective date of the notice of displacement or the notice to vacate or,
</P>
<P>(vi) A person who is required to temporarily vacate the premises in order to permit fumigation, repair, painting, or other maintenance or code of enforcement work or,

</P>
<P>(j) <I>Farm Operation.</I> Any activity conducted solely or primarily for the production of one or more types of agricultural products or commodities, including timber, for sale or home use, and customarily producing such products or commodities in sufficient quantity to be capable of contributing materially to the operator's support.

<HEAD>§ 777.14   Certain indirect actions prohibited.</HEAD>
<P>Postal employees shall take no indirect, coercive, or deceptive actions to cause persons to move from real property in an effort to avoid the circumstances under which such persons would be eligible to receive relocation benefits as displaced persons under these regulations. If a claimant demonstrates that such prohibited action caused him or her to move, he or she will be treated as a displaced person hereunder, if he or she otherwise meets the definition of a displaced person.

<HEAD>Subpart B—Uniform Relocation Assistance</HEAD>


<DIV8 N="§ 777.21" NODE="39:1.0.1.12.54.2.1.1" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 777.21   General procedures.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Planning Prior to Site Selection.</I> When acquisition of a site under consideration would likely involve displacement of a person eligible under § 777.13 for relocation assistance, the Postal Service representative shall prepare a relocation needs and availability analysis. The Postal Service representative shall include in the analysis a complete inventory of persons who may be displaced and specifically identify their needs.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Planning Subsequent to Site Selection.</I> Subsequent to site selection, the Postal Service must review the relocation needs and availability analysis and establish a specific plan for providing the assistance covered by these regulations to any eligible displaced persons. It will further determine the necessity of establishing an on-site relocation office which would be accessible to displaced persons and would be staffed with relocation personnel qualified to render all relocation services. The Postal Service will assure that cost estimates reflect current market conditions and that funding is available for all relocation assistance and activities.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Contracting for Relocation Services.</I> When the Postal Service determines it to be advantageous, it may enter into a relocation assistance service contract with a public agency or private firm having expertise in relocation assistance. The contract must require the contractor to follow Postal Service relocation assistance regulations.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Notice to Vacate, Ninety Day Requirement.</I> Postal Service notices to vacate must be issued at least 90 days prior to the date the property must be vacated. Any such notice must be in writing and delivered in person with receipt acknowledged, or by certified mail, return receipt requested. The 90-day requirement does not apply to any such notice issued subsequent to a valid notice to vacate issued by the prior owner of the property. A 90-day notice may be given with, or such notice may be combined with, but such notice must not be given before, the notice of displacement referred to in paragraph (f) of this section.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Shorter Notice Period, Unusual Circumstances.</I> An occupant may be required to vacate the property on less than 90 days advance written notice if the Postal Service determines that a 90-day notice is impracticable. An example of such a situation is when the person's continued occupancy of the property would constitute a substantial danger to the person's health or safety.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Notice of Displacement.</I> Normally, a notice of displacement will be given at the time of acquisition or later. Such notice must not be given earlier than the time of contracting, except in the case of acquisitions by eminent domain or by the threat of eminent domain. Such notice may be given at the time of contracting or between the time of contracting and the time of acquisition if the Postal Service considers it wise to start the displacement process then and if, in the judgment of the Postal Service, it is clear that person will in fact be a displaced person.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Notice of Availability of Advisory Services.</I> The notice of displacement will state that relocation assistance advisory services will be available to the displaced person and will designate who will provide such services.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Eviction for cause.</I> Any person occupying real property and not in unlawful occupancy on the date of initiation of negotiations is presumed to be entitled to relocation payments and other assistance unless the Postal Service determines that:
</P>
<P>(1) The person received an eviction notice prior to initiation of negotiations and, as a result of that notice, is later evicted; or
</P>
<P>(2) The person is evicted after initiation of negotiations for serious or repeated violation of material terms of the lease or occupancy agreement; and 
</P>
<P>(3) In either case the eviction is not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to make the relocation payments and other assistance available.

<HEAD>§ 777.22   Relocation assistance advisory services.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> The Postal Service carries out an advisory assistance program for displaced persons.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Relocation Information.</I> The Postal Service must contact each displaced person to provide an informational statement outlining the assistance available to the particular person. If it is impracticable to contact the displaced persons personally, the informational statement must be mailed to the persons, certified mail, return receipt requested.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Time of Initial Contact to Provide Relocation Information.</I> The initial contact to provide relocation information must take place by the following dates:
</P>
<P>(1) Where acquisition of the property is to occur as a result of the exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent domain, at the time of initiation of negotiation or within 30 days thereafter.
</P>
<P>(2) In any other instance such contact must be made prior to acquisition and prior to the notice of displacement or the notice to vacate, but it should normally not be made prior to contracting for the acquisition.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Service to be Provided.</I> The advisory program shall include such services as may be necessary or appropriate to:
</P>
<P>(1) Provide current information on the availability, purchase prices, financing, and rental costs of replacement dwellings.
</P>
<P>(2) For displaced persons eligible for replacement housing payments, explain that the displaced person cannot be required to move unless at least one comparable replacement dwelling is made available.
</P>
<P>(i) At the request of the displaced person, the Postal Service must inform that person, in writing, of the specific comparable replacement dwelling used as the basis for the replacement housing payment offer, the price or rent used to establish the upper limit of that offer, the basis for the determination, and the amount of the replacement housing payment to which he or she may be entitled.
</P>
<P>(ii) Where feasible, housing must be inspected by the Postal Service representative prior to its being made available to assure that it is a comparable replacement dwelling and meets the decent, safe, and sanitary standard. The displaced person must be notified that a replacement housing payment will not be made unless the replacement dwelling is inspected and determined to be decent, safe, and sanitary.
</P>
<P>(iii) Whenever possible, minority displaced persons must be given reasonable opportunities to relocate to comparable dwellings, not located in an area of minority concentration, that are within their financial means. This policy, however, does not require the Postal Service to provide a person a larger payment than is necessary to enable that person to relocate to a comparable replacement dwelling.
</P>
<P>(iv) All displaced persons, especially the elderly and handicapped, must be offered transportation to inspect housing to which they are referred.
</P>
<P>(3) Provide current and continuing information on the availability, purchase prices, and rental costs of comparable and suitable commercial and farm properties and locations, and assist any person displaced from a business or farm operation to obtain and become established in a suitable replacement location.
</P>
<P>(4) Minimize hardships to displaced persons in adjusting to relocation by providing counseling, advice about other sources of assistance that may be available, and such other help as may be appropriate.
</P>
<P>(5) Supply displaced persons with appropriate information concerning Federal, State, and local housing programs, disaster loan and other programs administered by the Small Business Administration, and other Federal, State, and local programs offering assistance to displaced persons.
</P>
<P>(6) Upon selection of a replacement property by a displaced person, the Postal Service may arrange for a representative to assist the displaced person with necessary arrangements for the move.

</P>
<P>(4) Persons who are required to move or to move personal property from real property, an interest in which is not acquired by the Postal Service, when it is determined by the Postal Service that such move is necessary or reasonable because of the Postal Service's having acquired an interest in other real property owned or leased by such persons and on which such persons conduct a business or farm operation, under circumstances where such persons are displaced persons with regard to such other real property or would have been displaced persons with regard to such other real property had they been required to move or to move personal property from such other real property, are entitled to benefits as residential, business or farm displaced persons under paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section.
</P>

</P>
<P>(i) The fair market value of the item for continued use at the displacement site, less the proceeds from its sale. (To be eligible for this payment the claimant must make a good faith effort to sell the personal property, unless the Postal Service determines that such effort is not necessary. When payment for property loss is claimed for goods held for sale, the fair market value must be based on the cost of the goods to the business, not the potential selling price.); or
</P>
<P>(ii) The estimated cost of moving the item no more than 50 miles, but with no allowance for storage.
</P>
<P>(8) If an item of personal property which is used as part of a business or farm operation is not moved, is promptly replaced with a substitute item that performs a comparable function at the replacement site, the displaced person is entitled to payment of the lesser of:

<P>(9) A displaced business or farm operation is entitled to reimbursement for actual expenses, not to exceed $1,000, which the Postal Service determines to be reasonable and which are incurred in searching for a replacement location. These expenses include transportation, meals and lodging away from home, time spent searching (based on reasonable salary or earnings) and fees paid to a real estate agent or broker to locate a replacement site, exclusive of any fees or commissions related to the purchase of such site.
</P>

</P>
<P>(e) <I>Fixed Payment in Lieu of Moving Expenses, Business Moves.</I> Any displaced business, other than an outdoor advertising display business, or a non-profit organization, is eligible for a fixed payment in lieu of actual moving and related expenses. This payment must be in an amount equal to the average annual net earnings of the business at that location, as computed under paragraph (i) of this section, but not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. For a displaced person to qualify for this payment, the Postal Service must determine that:
</P>
<P>(1) The business owns or rents personal property which must be moved in connection with such displacement and for which an expense would be incurred in such move; and, the business vacates or relocates from its displacement site; and
</P>
<P>(2) The business cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of its existing patronage (clientele or net earnings). A business is assumed to meet this test unless the Postal Service determines that it will not suffer a substantial loss of its existing patronage; and
</P>
<P>(3) The business is not part of a commercial enterprise having more than three other entities which are not being acquired by the Postal Service, and which are under the same ownership and engaged in the same or similar business activities.
</P>
<P>(4) The business contributed materially to the income of the displaced person during the 2 taxable years prior to displacement (see paragraph (h) of this section). However, the Postal Service may waive this test for good cause.
</P>
<P>(5) The business is not operated at a displacement dwelling solely for the purpose of renting such dwelling to others.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Determining the Number of Businesses.</I> In determining whether two or more displaced legal entities constitute a single business which is entitled to only one fixed payment, all pertinent factors shall be considered, including the extent to which: 
</P>
<P>(1) The same premises and equipment are shared;
</P>
<P>(2) Substantially identical or interrelated business functions are carried out and business and financial affairs are commingled;
</P>
<P>(3) The entities are held out to the public, and to those customarily dealing with them, as one business; and 
</P>
<P>(4) The same person or closely related persons own, control, or manage the affairs of the entities.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Fixed Payment in Lieu of Moving Expenses, Farm Operation.</I> Any displaced farm operation may choose a fixed payment in lieu of a payment for actual moving and related expenses in an amount equal to its average annual net earnings as computed in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section, but not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. For a displaced person to qualify for this payment, the Postal Service must determine that the farm operation contributed materially to the income of the displaced person during the two taxable years prior to the displacement (see paragraph (h) of this section). In the case of acquisition of land which was part of a farm operation before the acquisition, the fixed payment shall be made only if the Postal Service determines that: 
</P>
<P>(1) The acquisition of part of the land caused the operator to be displaced from the operation on the remaining land; or 
</P>
<P>(2) The partial acquisition caused a substantial change in the nature of the farm operation.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Contributes materially.</I> The term “contributes materially,” as used in paragraphs (e) and (g) of this section means that, during the 2 taxable years prior to the taxable year in which displacement occurs, or during such other period as the Postal Service determines to be more equitable, a business or farm operation:
</P>
<P>(1) Had average annual gross receipts of at least $5,000; or
</P>
<P>(2) Had average annual net earnings of at least $1,000; or 
</P>
<P>(3) Contributed at least 33
<FR>1/3</FR> percent of the owner's or operator's average annual gross income from all sources. 
</P>
<P>(4) If the application of the above criteria creates an inequity or hardship in any given case, the Postal Service may approve the use of other criteria as determined appropriate.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Average Annual Net Earnings of a Business or Farm Operation.</I> The average annual net earnings of a business or farm operation are one-half of its net earnings before Federal, State, and local income taxes during the 2 taxable years immediately prior to the taxable year in which it was displaced. If the business or farm was not in operation for the full 2 taxable years prior to displacement, net earnings shall be based on the actual period of operation at the displacement site during the 2 taxable years prior to displacement, projected to an annual rate. Average annual net earnings may be based upon a different period of time when the Postal Service determines it to be more equitable. Net earnings include any compensation obtained from the business or farm operation by its owner, the owner's spouse, and dependents. The displaced person shall furnish the Postal Service proof of net earnings through income tax returns, certified financial statements, or other reasonable evidence which the Postal Service determines is satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Nonprofit Organizations.</I> Any displaced nonprofit organization may choose a fixed payment in lieu of a payment for actual moving and related expenses in an amount of $2,500, if the Postal Service determines that it:
</P>

<HEAD>§ 777.24   Replacement housing payments.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Residential displaced persons are eligible for replacement housing payments as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) Residential displaced persons who lawfully and continuously owned and occupied a displacement dwelling for not less than 180 days prior to the initiation of negotiations are entitled to the benefits set out in paragraph (b) of this section. Such displaced persons may alternately choose the benefits under paragraph (f) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) Residential displaced persons who lawfully and continuously owned and occupied, and residential displaced persons who were tenants and lawfully and continuously occupied, a displacement dwelling for not less than 90 days prior to the initiation of negotiations are entitled to the benefits set out in paragraph (e) of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) Where the replacement housing payment provided hereunder does not provide for housing within the financial means (see § 777.13(j)) of the displaced person, see § 777.27, Last Resort Housing.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Benefits for 180 Day Owner Occupants.</I> Displaced persons eligible under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are entitled to benefits as set out below:
</P>
<P>(1) An amount which is the sum of:
</P>
<P>(i) The amount which must be added to the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling to provide a total amount equal to the lesser of:
</P>
<P>(A) The reasonable cost of a comparable replacement dwelling as determined by paragraph (c) of this section; or
</P>
<P>(B) The purchase price of a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling actually purchased and occupied by the displaced person; plus
</P>
<P>(ii) Interest Cost (see paragraph (d) of this section); plus
</P>
<P>(iii) Incidental Expenses (see paragraph (h) of this section).
</P>
<P>(2) The benefits in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, are limited to a maximum payment of $22,500.
</P>
<P>(3) The benefits in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, are available only if a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling is purchased within 12 months after the latter of:
</P>
<P>(i) The date of acquisition or, in the case of condemnation, the date the required amount is deposited in a court for the displaced person's benefit, or
</P>
<P>(ii) The date the person moves from the displacement dwelling.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Determining the Cost of a Comparable Replacement Dwelling.</I> The cost of a comparable replacement dwelling for purposes of benefits to be paid to 180 day owner occupants will be determined by applying the following:
</P>
<P>(1) If available, at least three representative comparable replacement dwellings must be examined and the payment offer computed on the cost of the fair market value of the dwelling most closely comparable to the displacement dwelling.
</P>
<P>(2) To the extent, feasible, comparable replacement dwellings will be selected from the neighborhood in which the displacement dwelling was located. If this is not possible, comparable replacement dwellings will be selected from nearby or similar neighborhoods where housing costs are similar.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Increased Mortgage Interest Costs.</I> The amount to be paid to a displaced 180 day owner occupant for increased mortgage interest costs is the amount, if any, by which the present value of the interest on the mortgage loan(s) on the replacement dwelling plus any other debt service costs exceeds the present value of the interest on the mortgage loan(s) on the displacement dwelling plus purchaser's points and loan origination fees, subject to the following:
</P>
<P>(1) The payment must be based only on bona fide mortgages that were a valid lien on the displacement dwelling for at least 180 days prior to the initiation of negotiations. All such mortgages on the displacement dwelling must be used to compute the payment.
</P>
<P>(2) The payment must be based on the unpaid mortgage balance on the displacement dwelling or the new mortgage amount, whichever is less.
</P>
<P>(3) The payment must be based on the remaining term of the mortgage on the displacement dwelling or the actual term of the new mortgage, whichever is shorter.
</P>
<P>(4) The new mortgage must be a bona fide mortgage and its interest rate must not exceed the prevailing interest rate currently charged by mortgage lending institutions in the area in which the replacement dwelling is located.
</P>
<P>(5) The discount rate used to compute the present value of the increased interest cost must be the prevailing interest rate paid on demand savings deposits by commercial banks in the area in which the replacement dwelling is located.
</P>
<P>(6) Purchaser's points and loan origination fees, but not seller's points, are reimbursable to the extent they are not paid as incidental expenses, they do not exceed rates normal to similar real estate transactions in the area, and the Postal Service determines them to be necessary. The computation of such points and fees shall be based on the unpaid mortgage balance on the displacement dwelling, or the new mortgage amount, whichever is less.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Benefits for 90 Day Owner Occupant and Tenants.</I> Displaced persons eligible under paragraph (a)(2) of this section are entitled to benefits as set out below:
</P>
<P>(1) Rental assistance benefits, as set out in paragraph (f) of this section or downpayment assistance benefits, as set out in paragraph (g) of this section.
</P>
<P>(2) The benefits in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, are limited to $5,250.
</P>
<P>(3) The benefits in (e)(1) above are available only if a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling is purchased or rented within 12 months after the latter of:
</P>
<P>(i) The date of acquisition or, in the case of condemnation, the date the required amount is deposited in the court for the displaced person's benefit, or
</P>
<P>(ii) The date the person moves from the displacement dwelling.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Rental Assistance.</I> The rental assistance benefits, not to exceed $5,250, for 90 day owner occupants and tenants will be computed as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) The amount which must be added to 42 times the average monthly rental paid at the displacement dwelling (or, if the displaced person is an owner occupant, the fair market rental value had the displacement dwelling been rented) for the three-month period prior to displacement to provide a total amount equal to the lesser of:
</P>
<P>(i) 42 times the reasonable monthly rental of a comparable replacement dwelling; or 
</P>
<P>(ii) 42 times the actual monthly rental cost of the decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling actually rented and occupied by the displaced person.
</P>
<P>(2) If utilities are included in either the replacement dwelling or the displacement dwelling rent, appropriate utilities must be factored into both rentals. If utilities are not included in either monthly rental then the payment will be computed using the base rental rates.
</P>
<P>(3) If, in the opinion of the Postal Service, the monthly rental at the displacement dwelling is significantly below the fair market rent of the displacement dwelling, such fair market rent must be used in computing the rental assistance payment.
</P>
<P>(4) The payment under this section must be disbursed in a lump-sum amount unless the Postal Service determines on a case-by-case basis, for good cause, that the payment should be made in installments. Where the rental assistance payment exceeds $5,250 under the provisions of Last Resort Housing, (§ 777.27), installment payments or payments through escrow accounts may be considered.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Downpayment assistance.</I> Downpayment assistance, not to exceed $5,250, is available to 90 day owner occupants and 90 day tenants. This $5,250 amount may be considered to include the full amount of the required downpayment and incidental expenses.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Incidental Expenses.</I> Incidental expenses covered under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) or (g) of this section are those reasonable costs actually incurred by the displaced person incident to the purchase of a replacement dwelling and customarily paid by the buyer (not to exceed the costs of such for a comparable replacement dwelling). They include: 
</P>
<P>(1) Legal, closing, and related costs, including those for title search and insurance, preparing conveyance instruments, notary fees, preparing surveys and plats, and recording fees.
</P>
<P>(2) Lender, FHA, or VA appraisal fees.
</P>
<P>(3) FHA or VA application fee.
</P>
<P>(4) Certification of structural soundness when required by the lender.
</P>
<P>(5) Credit report.
</P>
<P>(6) Owner's and mortgagee's evidence or assurance of title. 
</P>
<P>(7) Escrow agent's fee.
</P>
<P>(8) State revenue or documentary stamps, sales or transfer taxes.
</P>
<P>(9) Such other costs as the Postal Service determines to be incidental to the purchase.

<HEAD>§ 777.25   Additional rules for replacement housing payments.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Multiple Owners.</I> When a single family dwelling is owned by more than one person and occupied by only some of the 180 day owners (for example, when the dwelling is owned by an estate and only one of the heirs is in occupancy), the occupant(s) is (are) eligible to receive a maximum total price differential which is the lesser of:
</P>
<P>(1) The difference between (i) the reasonable cost of a comparable replacement dwelling, as determined under § 777.24(c) and (ii) the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling; or 
</P>
<P>(2) The difference between (i) the occupant's share of the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling and (ii) the purchase price of a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling actually purchased and occupied by the displaced person.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Multiple Occupants of One Displacement Dwelling.</I> If two or more occupants of the displacement dwelling move to separate replacement dwellings, each occupant is entitled to a reasonable prorated share, as determined by the Postal Service, of any relocation payments that would have been made if the occupants moved together to a comparable replacement dwelling. However, if the Postal Service determines that two or more occupants maintained separate households within the same dwelling, such occupants have separate entitlements to relocation payments.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Mixed Use and Multi-Family Properties Acquired.</I> If the displacement dwelling was part of a property that contained another dwelling unit or space used for non-residential purposes, or if it is located on a lot larger than that typical for residential purposes, only that portion of the acquisition payment which is actually attributable to the displacement dwelling and site can be considered its acquisition cost when computing the price differential.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Disaster-Related Insurance Proceeds.</I> To the extent necessary to avoid duplicate compensation, the amount of any insurance proceeds received by a person in connection with a disaster related loss to the displacement dwelling must be included in the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling when computing the price differential.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Inspection of Replacement Dwelling.</I> Before making a replacement housing payment or releasing a payment from escrow, the Postal Service must inspect the replacement dwelling and determine that it is a decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Purchase of Replacement Dwelling.</I> A displaced person is considered to have met the requirement to purchase a replacement dwelling if the person has purchased an existing dwelling; purchased and rehabilitated or moved and restored an existing dwelling; or constructed a new dwelling, provided in each instance the dwelling is determined to be decent, safe and sanitary.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Conversion of Payment.</I> A displaced person who initially rents a replacement dwelling and receives a rental assistance payment may, within the required 12 month eligibility period, purchase a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling. In such case, he or she is eligible to revise his or her original claim, and claim any additional assistance for which he or she was originally eligible. However, any portion of the rental assistance payment that has been disbursed must be deducted from the resultant replacement housing payment or downpayment assistance payment.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Payment After Death.</I> A replacement housing payment is personal to the displaced person. Upon his or her death, the undisbursed portion of any such payment shall not be paid to the heirs or assigns, except that:
</P>
<P>(1) The amount attributable to the displaced person's period of actual occupancy of the replacement housing will be paid.
</P>
<P>(2) The full payment must be disbursed in any case in which a member of a displaced family dies and other family members continue to occupy the replacement dwelling selected in accordance with these regulations.
</P>
<P>(3) Any portion of a replacement housing payment necessary to satisfy the legal obligation of an estate in connection with the selection of a replacement dwelling by or on behalf of a deceased person must be disbursed to the estate.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>180 Day Owner Retention of Displacement Dwelling.</I> If a 180 day owner occupant retains ownership of his or her dwelling or the right to move his or her dwelling from the displacement site, and he or she moves it and reoccupies it on a replacement site, the cost of the actual replacement dwelling to be computed for purposes of § 777.24(b)(1)(i)(A) (not to exceed the purchase price of a comparable replacement dwelling) will be the sum of:
</P>
<P>(1) The expenses of moving and restoring the retained dwelling to a condition comparable to that prior to the move; and
</P>
<P>(2) The salvage or other value deducted from the acquisition cost for the retained ownership; and
</P>
<P>(3) Additional costs, if necessary, incurred to make the unit a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling; and
</P>
<P>(4) The cost of the replacement site, not to exceed the cost of a comparable available and suitable replacement site.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>90 Day Owner/Retention of Displacement Dwelling.</I> A 90 day owner occupant who retains ownership of his or her dwelling or the right to remove his or her dwelling may receive the benefits as if he or she were a 180 day owner occupant subject, however, to a limitation of $5,250 on maximum benefits in lieu of the $22,500 limitation set out in paragraph § 777.24(b)(2).

</P>
<P>(1) If the person owns the mobile home, moving expenses may, at the owner's option, include any reasonable costs incurred to move the mobile home to a replacement site, plus the reasonable cost of disassembling, moving, and reassembling any attached appurtenances (such as porches, decks, skirting, and awnings) which were not acquired, anchoring of the unit, and utility “hook-up charges.”
</P>
<P>(2) If the person rents the mobile home, the Postal Service may allow the person moving expense benefits for moving the mobile home as if the person were an owner of the mobile home under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) If costs of moving a mobile home are paid as moving expenses under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, the person may not receive housing assistance benefits hereunder, other than any benefits to which they are entitled that are limited to the site of the mobile home.
</P>
<P>(4) Displaced occupants of mobile homes are eligible for moving expenses for personal property other than the mobile home and its appurtenances, but only to the extent the Postal Service does not pay the costs of moving the mobile home (either as moving expenses or replacement housing payments or, if it does pay such costs, the personal property is of a type that is customarily moved separately from the mobile home.)
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Replacement Housing Payments.</I> Displaced persons who are 180 day or 90 day occupants of mobile homes qualify for replacement housing payments under § 777.24 subject to the following:
</P>
<P>(1) If the displaced person owns the mobile home and owns the site, the person is eligible for benefits under either § 777.24 (b) or (e).

<P>(3) If the displaced person rents the mobile home and owns the site the person is eligible for benefits under § 777.24(e), with regard to the mobile home and to benefits under § 777.24(b) with regard to the site, subject to a limitation on the home and site benefits combined of $22,500. (Persons who voluntarily sell mobile home sites are not displaced persons and are not entitled to benefits under Subpart B. See § 777.13(e)(2)(viii)).
</P>
<P>(4) If the displaced person owns the mobile home and rents the site the person is eligible for benefits under either § 777.24 (b) or (e) with regard to the mobile home and to benefits as a tenant under § 777.24(e) with regard to the site, subject to a limitation on home and site benefits combined of $5,250.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Special Rules for Mobile Homes.</I> (1) In computing replacement housing payments for mobile home owners under paragraph (b) of this section, apply the terms of § 777.25 (i) and (j) as appropriate, to transactions involving moving the mobile home to a new site.
</P>
<P>(2) The acquisition of a portion of a mobile home park may leave a remainder that is not adequate to continue the operation of the park. When the Postal Service determines that its acquisition of the real property has had this effect and that for this reason a mobile home occupant located on the remaining part of the property is required to move, such occupant shall be considered a displaced person under these regulations and shall be entitled to such benefits hereunder as the person would otherwise qualify.

<P>(b) <I>Basic Rights of Persons to be Displaced.</I> The provisions of this section do not deprive any displaced person of any rights the person may have under these regulations such as the right to accept the maximum replacement housing payment available under these regulations and to move to a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling even if such dwelling is beyond the person's financial means.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Methods of Providing Replacement Housing.</I> The Postal Service has broad latitude in implementing this section, but implementation must be on a reasonable cost basis. The Postal Service may provide last resort housing using the following methods:
</P>
<P>(1) Rehabilitation of and/or additions to an existing replacement dwelling.

<DIV8 N="§ 777.31" NODE="39:1.0.1.12.54.3.1.1" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 777.31   Acquisition procedures.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Policy; Application of Section.</I> The Postal Service, as a matter of policy, acquires interests in real property through voluntary agreements with owners. Only under unusual and compelling circumstances, and on a case-by-case basis, does the Postal Service acquire real property through the exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent domain. This policy does not, however, prevent the Postal Service from occasionally entering into mutually agreeable condemnation proceedings with an owner, where price is not an issue, and for such purposes as to clear title or to acquire property from certain elected officials. For the purposes of this section, the Postal Service does not consider such voluntary and mutually agreeable uses of condemnation proceedings as the exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent domain. The following regulations apply only to acquisitions by the exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent domain:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Notice to Owner.</I> As soon as feasible after deciding to acquire a specific property through the exercise of eminent domain, the Postal Service must notify the owner of its intent to acquire the property.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Expeditious Negotiations.</I> The Postal Service must make every reasonable effort to acquire real property expeditiously by negotiation.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Appraisal and Invitation to Owner.</I> Before the initiation of negotiations, the real property shall be appraised in accordance with Postal Service appraisal standards as outlined in RE-1 and the owner or the owner's designated agent shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during the appraiser's inspection of the property.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Establishment of Offer of Just Compensation.</I> Prior to the initiation of negotiations (see § 777.13(k) for definition) the Postal Service must establish an amount which it believes is just compensation for the real property rights be acquired. The amount must not be less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value, including damages or benefits to the remaining property. Appraisers shall not give consideration to, or include in their real property appraisals, any allowances for the benefits provided by title II of the Act.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Summary Statement.</I> Promptly after determining fair market value, the Postal Service shall make a written offer to acquire the property for the full amount believed to be just compensation. Along with the written purchase offer, the owner must be given a written statement of the basis for the offer of just compensation. This statement must include:
</P>
<P>(i) A statement of the amount offered as just compensation. In the case of a partial acquisition, the compensation for the real property to be acquired and the compensation for damages, if any, must be separately stated.
</P>
<P>(ii) The location and description of the real property and the interest(s) to be acquired.
</P>
<P>(iii) An identification of the buildings, structures, and other improvements (including removable building equipment and trade fixtures) which are considered part of the real property for which the offer of just compensation is made. Where appropriate, the statement shall identify and separately held ownership interest in the improvement(s), for example, a tenant-owned improvement.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Basic Negotiation Procedures.</I> The Postal Service must make every reasonable effort to contact the owner or the owner's representative and:
</P>
<P>(i) Discuss the Postal Service's offer to purchase the property including the basis for the offer of just compensation, and;
</P>
<P>(ii) Explain Postal Service acquisition policies and procedures including the provisions for the payment of incidental expenses as described under § 777.33.
</P>
<P>(7) <I>Opportunity to Consider Offer.</I> The owner must be given a reasonable opportunity to consider the Postal Service's offer, to present material which he or she believes is relevant to determining the value of the property, and to suggest modification in the proposed terms and conditions of the purchase. The Postal Service must consider the owner's presentation. 
</P>
<P>(8) <I>Updating Offer of Just Compensation.</I> If the information presented by the owner or a material change in the character or condition of the property indicates the need for new appraisal information, or if a significant delay has occurred since the time of the appraisal(s) of the property, the Postal Service must have the appraisal(s) updated or obtain a new appraisal(s). If the latest appraisal information indicates that a change in the purchase offer is warranted, the Postal Service must promptly reestablish just compensation and offer the revised amount to the owner in writing. 
</P>
<P>(9) <I>Contracts and Options.</I> Contracts to purchase shall cover only those items related to the acquisition of the property, and not incorporate provisions for making payments for relocation costs or related costs under title II of these regulations. 
</P>
<P>(10) <I>Title II Benefits Not To Be Considered.</I> In the event of condemnation, estimated compensation shall be determined solely on the basis of the appraised value of the real property with no consideration being given to or reference contained therein to the payments to be made under title II. 
</P>
<P>(11) <I>Coercive Action.</I> The Postal Service shall not advance the time of condemnation, or defer negotiations or condemnation, or the deposit of funds with the court, or take any other coercive action in order to induce an agreement on the price to be paid for the property. 
</P>
<P>(12) <I>Inverse Condemnation.</I> If the Postal Service intends to acquire any interest in real property by exercise of the power of eminent domain, it must institute formal condemnation proceedings and not intentionally make it necessary for the owner to institute proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of the real property. 
</P>
<P>(13) <I>Payment Before Taking Possession.</I> Before requiring the owner to surrender possession of the real property, the Postal Service must either: 
</P>
<P>(i) Pay the agreed purchase price to the owner; or 
</P>
<P>(ii) In the case of a condemnation proceeding, deposit with the court for the benefit of the owner an amount not less than the amount of the approved appraised value of the property or the amount of the award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding for the property. 
</P>
<P>(14) <I>Right-of-Entry.</I> With the prior approval of the owner, the Postal Service may obtain a right-of-entry before making payment to the owner.

<HEAD>§ 777.32   Acquisition of tenant-owned improvements.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Acquisition of Improvements.</I> When acquiring any interest in real property, the Postal Service must acquire at least an equal interest in all buildings, structures, or other improvements located upon the real property. This must include any improvement of a tenant owner who has the right or obligation to remove the improvement at the expiration of the lease term.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Special Conditions.</I> Payment for tenant-owned improvements will be made to the tenant only if he or she meets the following conditions: 
</P>
<P>(1) In consideration for the payment the tenant-owner assigns, transfers, and releases to the Postal Service all of the tenant-owner's rights, title, and interests in the improvement;
</P>
<P>(2) The owner of the real property on which the improvement is located disclaims all interest in the improvement; and 
</P>
<P>(3) The payment does not result in the duplication of any compensation otherwise authorized by law. 
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Preservation of Tenant's Rights.</I> Nothing in this section shall be construed to deprive the tenant-owner of any rights to reject payment under this section and to obtain payment for such property interests in accordance with other applicable law.

<HEAD>§ 777.33   Expenses incidental to transfer of title to the Postal Service.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Reimbursement.</I> When property is acquired through the exercise or the threat of the exercise of eminent domain, the owner shall be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses he or she necessarily incurred in conveying the real property to the Postal Service for: 
</P>
<P>(1) Recording fees, transfer taxes, documentary stamps, evidence of title, boundary surveys, legal descriptions of the real property, and similar incidental expenses. However, the Postal Service will not pay costs solely required to perfect the owner's title to the real property. 
</P>
<P>(2) Penalty costs and other charges for prepayment of any preexisting recorded mortgage, entered into in good faith, encumbering the real property. 
</P>
<P>(3) The pro rata portion of any prepaid real property taxes which are allocable to the period after the Postal Service obtains title to the property or effective possession of it, whichever is earlier. 
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Direct Payment.</I> Whenever feasible the Postal Service must pay these costs directly and thus avoid the need for an owner to pay such costs and then seek reimbursement from the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Certain Litigation Expenses.</I> The owner of the real property acquired must be reimbursed any reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney, appraisal, and engineering fees which the owner actually incurred because of a condemnation proceeding if: 
</P>
<P>(1) The final judgment of the court is that the Postal Service cannot acquire the real property by condemnation; or 
</P>
<P>(2) The condemnation proceeding is abandoned by the Postal Service other than under an agreed-upon settlement; or 
</P>
<P>(3) The court having jurisdiction renders a judgment in favor of the owner in an inverse condemnation proceeding or the Postal Service effects a settlement of such a proceeding.

<P>(b) <I>Tenant-Owned Improvements.</I> In general the Postal Service deals exclusively with the fee owner on the acquisition of all real property interest at the site. The Postal Service may, however, in exceptional cases deal directly with a tenant on a leasehold improvements matter. Should the Postal Service acquire the fee interest without acquiring rights in a leasehold improvement under circumstances in which the tenant would be entitled to compensation under § 777.32 of this part, if the acquisition were by eminent domain or the under threat thereof, the tenant will be entitled to the benefits that would, under such circumstances, have been paid under § 777.32 of this part, unless the tenant has formally disclaimed further right in the real property improvement beyond the time of the expiration of his or her tenancy.

<P>This part prescribes procedures governing the disposition of recovered stolen mail matter and any other property (real, personal, tangible or intangible) obtained by the Postal Inspection Service for possible use as evidence after the need to retain such property no longer exists. Property obtained by Postal Inspectors which appears to have been loose in the mails but is not retained for use as evidence, except unlawful matter, must be treated in accordance with postal regulations concerning disposition of dead mail (see Domestic Manual (DMM) 159.4). Unlawful matter must be disposed of in accordance with § 946.3.

<P>Claims submitted with respect to property subject to this part, possession of which is unlawful, must be denied, in writing, by certified mail and the person submitting the claim must be accorded 45 days from the postmarked date to institute judicial proceedings to challenge the denial. If judicial proceedings are not instituted within 45 days, or any extension of time for good cause shown, the contraband property must be destroyed unless the Chief Postal Inspector or delegate determines that it should be placed in official use by the Postal Inspection Service. Property subject to this part, the disposition of which is involved in litigation or is subject to an order of court, must be disposed of as determined by the court.

Publication of notice pursuant to § 946.4 provides constructive notice unless a claimant can demonstrate circumstances which reasonably precluded his access to the published notice.

<P>(a) <I>General.</I> Upon written request of either party filed with the Recorder or on his or her own initiative, the presiding officer may issue a subpoena requiring:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Testimony at a deposition.</I> The deposing of a witness in the city or county where the witness resides or is employed or transacts business in person, or at another location convenient for the witness that is specifically determined by the presiding officer;
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Testimony at a hearing.</I> The attendance of a witness for the purpose of taking testimony at a hearing; and
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Production of records.</I> The production by the witness at a deposition or hearing of records designated in the subpoena.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Voluntary cooperation.</I> Each party is expected:
</P>
<P>(1) To cooperate and make available witnesses and evidence under its possession, custody or control as requested by the other party, without issuance of a subpoena, and
</P>
<P>(2) To secure voluntary production of desired third-party records whenever possible.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Requests for subpoenas.</I> (1) A request for a subpoena shall to the extent practical be filed:
</P>
<P>(i) At the same time a request for deposition is filed; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Fifteen (15) days before a scheduled hearing where the attendance of a witness at a hearing is sought.
</P>
<P>(2) A request for a subpoena shall state the reasonable scope and relevance to the case of the testimony and of any records sought.
</P>
<P>(3) The presiding officer, in his or her sole discretion, may honor requests for subpoenas not presented within the time limitations specified in this paragraph.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Motion to quash or modify.</I> (1) Upon written request by the person subpoenaed or by a party, the presiding officer may:
</P>
<P>(i) Quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable, oppressive or for other good cause shown, or
</P>
<P>(ii) Require the person in whose behalf the subpoena was issued to advance the reasonable cost of producing subpoenaed records. Where circumstances require, the presiding officer may act upon such a request at any time after a copy has been served upon the opposing party.
</P>
<P>(2) Motions to quash or modify a subpoena shall be filed within 10 days of service, or at least one day prior to any scheduled hearing, whichever first occurs. The presiding officer, in his or her sole discretion, may entertain motions to quash or modify not made within the time limitations specified in this paragraph.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Form; issuance.</I> (1) Every subpoena shall state the title of the proceeding, shall cite 39 U.S.C. 3016(a)(2) as the authority under which it is issued, and shall command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony, and if appropriate, to produce specified records at a time and place therein specified. In issuing a subpoena to a requesting party, the presiding officer shall sign the subpoena and may, in his or her discretion, enter the name of the witness and otherwise leave it blank. The party to whom the subpoena is issued shall complete the subpoena before service.
</P>
<P>(2) The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be responsible for the payment of fees and mileage of the witness in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821, or other applicable law, and of the officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such charges on demand may be deemed by the presiding officer as sufficient ground for striking the testimony of the witness and the evidence the witness has produced.
</P>
<P>(f)(1) <I>Service in general.</I> The party requesting issuance of a subpoena shall arrange for service.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Service within the United States.</I> A subpoena issued under this section may be served by a person designated under 18 U.S.C. 3061 or by a United States marshal or deputy marshal, or by any other person who is not a party and not less than 18 years of age at any place within the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Service outside the United States.</I> Any such subpoena may be served upon any person who is not to be found within the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States, in such manner as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure prescribe for service in a foreign country. To the extent that the courts of the United States may assert jurisdiction over such person consistent with due process, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have the same jurisdiction to take any action respecting compliance with this section by such person that such court would have if such person were personally within the jurisdiction of such court.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Service on business persons.</I> Service of any such subpoena may be made upon a partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity by:
</P>
<P>(i) Delivering a duly executed copy thereof to any partner, executive officer, managing agent, or general agent thereof, or to any agent thereof authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process on behalf of such partnership, corporation, association, or entity;
</P>
<P>(ii) Delivering a duly executed copy thereof to the principal office or place of business of the partnership, corporation, association, or entity; or
</P>
<P>(iii) Depositing such copy in the United States mails, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, duly addressed to such partnership, corporation, association, or entity at its principal office or place of business.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Service on natural persons.</I> Service of any subpoena may be made upon any natural person by:
</P>
<P>(i) Delivering a duly executed copy to the person to be served; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Depositing such copy in the United States mails, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, duly addressed to such person at his or her residence or principal office or place of business.
</P>
<P>(6) <I>Verified return.</I> A verified return by the individual serving any such subpoena setting forth the manner of such service shall constitute proof of service. In the case of service by registered or certified mail, such return shall be accompanied by the return post office receipt of delivery of such subpoena, or a statement of service by registered or certified mail in the event that receipt of delivery is unavailable.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena.</I> In the case of refusal to obey a subpoena, the Judicial Officer may request the Attorney General to petition the district court for any district in which the person receiving the subpoena resides, is found, or conducts business (or in the case of a person outside the territorial jurisdiction of any district court, the district court for the District of Columbia) to issue an appropriate order for the enforcement of such subpoena. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punishable as contempt.

<HEAD>§ 952.21   Discovery.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Voluntary discovery.</I> The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures. In connection with any deposition or other discovery procedure, the presiding officer may issue any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, and those orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place for discovery, and provisions for protecting the secrecy of confidential information or documents.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Discovery disputes.</I> The parties are required to make a good faith effort to resolve objections to discovery requests informally. A party receiving an objection to a discovery request, or a party which believes that another party's response to a discovery request is incomplete or entirely absent, may file a motion to compel a response, but such a motion must include a representation that the moving party has tried in good faith, prior to filing the motion, to resolve the matter informally. The motion to compel shall include a copy of each discovery request at issue and the response, if any.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Discovery limitations.</I> The presiding officer may limit the frequency or extent of use of discovery methods described in these rules. In doing so, generally the presiding officer will consider whether:
</P>
<P>(1) The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;
</P>
<P>(2) The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the case to obtain the information sought; or
</P>
<P>(3) The discovery is unduly burdensome and expensive, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, limitations on the parties' resources, and the importance of the issues at stake.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Interrogatories.</I> At any time after service of the complaint, a party may serve on the other party written interrogatories to be answered separately in writing, signed under oath and returned within 30 days. Upon timely objection, the presiding officer will determine the extent to which the interrogatories will be permitted.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Requests for admission.</I> At any time after service of the complaint, a party may serve upon the other party a request for the admission of specified facts. Within 30 days after service, the party served shall answer each requested fact or file objections thereto. The factual propositions set out in the request may be ordered by the presiding officer as deemed admitted upon the failure of a party to respond timely and fully to the request for admissions.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Requests for production of documents.</I> At any time after service of the complaint, a party may serve on the other party written requests for the production, inspection, and copying of any documents, electronically stored information, or things, to be answered within 30 days. Upon timely objection, the presiding officer will determine the extent to which the requests must be satisfied, and if the parties cannot themselves agree thereon, the presiding officer shall specify just terms and conditions for compliance.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Depositions.</I> Except as stated herein, depositions shall be conducted in accordance with Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
</P>
<P>(1) After a complaint has been filed and docketed, the parties may mutually agree to, or the presiding officer may, upon application of either party and for good cause shown, order the taking of testimony of any person by deposition upon oral examination or written interrogatories before any officer authorized to administer oaths at the place of examination, for use as evidence or for purpose of discovery. The application for order shall specify whether the purpose of the deposition is discovery or for use as evidence.
</P>
<P>(2) The time, place, and manner of conducting depositions shall be as mutually agreed by the parties or, failing such agreement, and upon proper application, governed by order of the presiding officer.
</P>
<P>(3) No testimony taken by deposition shall be considered as part of the evidence in the hearing of an appeal unless and until such testimony is offered and received in evidence at or before such hearing. It will not ordinarily be received in evidence if the deponent is available to testify at the hearing, but the presiding officer may admit testimony taken by deposition in his or her discretion. A deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the witness given at the hearing. In cases submitted on the written record in lieu of an oral hearing, the presiding officer may, in his or her discretion, receive depositions as evidence in supplementation of that record.
</P>
<P>(4) Each party shall bear its own expenses associated with the taking of any deposition unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Sanctions.</I> If a party fails to appear for a deposition, after being served with a proper notice, or fails to serve answers or objections to interrogatories, requests for admissions, or requests for the production or inspection of documents, after proper service, the party seeking discovery may request that the presiding officer impose appropriate orders. Failure of a party to comply with an order pursuant to this rule may result in the presiding officer's ruling that the disobedient party may not support or oppose designated charges or defenses or may not introduce designated matters in evidence. The presiding officer may also infer from the disobedient party's failure to comply with the order that the facts to which the order related would, if produced or admitted, be adverse to such party's interests. In the sole discretion of the presiding officer, failure of a party to comply with an order pursuant to this rule may result in the presiding officer's issuance of an order of default under § 952.11(c).

</P>
<P>(1) Not later than 5 days after the filing of the authorized officials's answer, any party may file application with the presiding officer for the taking of testimony by deposition. In support of such application the applicant shall submit under oath or affirmation a statement setting out the reasons why such testimony should be taken by deposition, the time and the place, and the name and address of the witness whose deposition is desired, the subject matter of the testimony of each witness, its relevancy, and the name and address of the person before whom the deposition is to be taken. 
</P>
<P>(2) If the application is granted, the order for the taking of the deposition will specify the time and place thereof, the name of the witness, the person before whom the deposition is to be taken and any other necessary information. 
</P>
<P>(3) Each witness testifying upon deposition shall be duly sworn by the deposition officer and the adverse party shall have the right to cross-examine. The questions and answers together with all objections, shall be reduced to writing and, unless waived by stipulation of the parties, shall be read to and subscribed by the witness in the presence of the deposition officer who shall certify it in the usual form. The deposition officer shall file the testimony taken by deposition as directed in the order. All objections made at the time of examination shall be noted by the deposition officer and the evidence objected to shall be taken subject to the objections. In lieu of participating in the oral examination, a party may transmit written interrogatories to the deposition officer, who shall propound them to the witness and record the answers verbatim. Objections to relevancy or materiality of testimony, or to errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of the parties and errors of any kind which might be obviated, cured or removed if promptly presented, are waived unless timely objection is made at the taking of the deposition. 
</P>
<P>(4) At the hearing any part or all of the deposition may be offered in evidence by any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had notice thereof. If the deposition is not offered and received in evidence, it shall not be considered as a part of the record in the proceeding. The admissibility of depositions or parts thereof shall be governed by the rules of evidence. 
</P>
<P>(5) The party requesting the deposition shall pay all fees required to be paid to witnesses and the deposition officer, and shall provide an original and one copy of the deposition for the official record, and shall serve one copy upon the opposing party. 
</P>
<P>(6) Within the United States or within a territory or insular possession subject to the dominion of the United States, depositions may be taken before an officer authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where the examination is held; within a foreign country, depositions may be taken before a secretary of an embassy or legation, consul general, vice consul or consular agent of the United States, or any other person designated in the order for the taking of a deposition. 
</P>
<P>(7) Depositions may also be taken and submitted on written interrogatories in substantially the same manner as depositions taken by oral examination. When a deposition is taken upon written interrogatories and cross-interrogatories, none of the parties shall be present or represented, and no person, other than the witness, a stenographic reporter, and the deposition officer shall be present at the examination of the witness, which fact shall be certified by the officer, who shall propound the interrogatories and cross-interrogatories to the witness in their order and reduce the testimony to writing in the witness' own words.

<HEAD>§ 955.1   Jurisdiction, procedure, service of documents.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Jurisdiction for considering appeals.</I> Pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41 U.S.C. 7101-7109, the Postal Service Board of Contract Appeals (Board) has jurisdiction to consider and decide any appeal from a decision of a contracting officer of the United States Postal Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission relative to a contract made by either. In addition the Board has jurisdiction over other matters assigned to it by the Postmaster General, and over matters otherwise authorized by applicable law.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Organization and location of the Board.</I> (1) The Board is located at 2101 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 600, Arlington, Virginia 22201-3078. The Board's telephone number is (703) 812-1900, and its website is <I>https://about.usps.com/who/judicial</I>. The Board's fax number is (703) 812-1901. The website for electronic filing is <I>https://usps-judicialoffice.journaltech.com</I>.
</P>
<P>(2) The Board consists of the Judicial Officer as Chairman, and the Judges of the Board, as appointed by the Postmaster General in accordance with the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41 U.S.C. 7101-7109. All members of the Board shall meet the qualifications established in the Contract Disputes Act. In general, appeals are assigned to a panel of at least three members of the Board. The decision of a majority of the panel constitutes the decision of the Board.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Board procedures—</I> (1) <I>Rules.</I> Appeals to the Board are handled in accordance with the rules of the Board.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Administration and interpretation of rules.</I> These rules will be interpreted so as to secure a just and inexpensive determination of appeals without unnecessary delay. Emphasis is placed upon the sound administration of these rules in specific cases, because it is impracticable to articulate a rule to fit every possible circumstance which may be encountered. The Board may consider the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for guidance in construing those Board rules that are similar to Federal Rules and for matters not specifically covered herein.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Time, computation, and extensions.</I> (i) All time limitations specified for various procedural actions are computed as maximums, and are not to be fully exhausted if the action described can be accomplished in a lesser period. These time limitations are similarly eligible for extension in appropriate circumstances.
</P>
<P>(ii) Unless otherwise specified by the Board, orders and decisions shall be considered received by the parties on the date posted to the electronic filing system. Except as otherwise provided by law, in computing any period of time prescribed by these rules or by any order of the Board, the day of the event from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included, but the last day of the period shall be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a federal holiday in which event the period shall run to the end of the next business day. Except as otherwise provided in these rules or an applicable order, prescribed periods of time are measured in calendar days rather than business days.
</P>
<P>(iii) Requests for extensions of time from either party shall be made in writing stating good cause therefor, shall represent that the moving party has contacted the opposing party about the request, or made reasonable and good faith efforts to do so, and shall indicate whether the opposing party consents to the extension. If the request for extension of time is filed after the time for taking the required action has expired, the request should indicate the reasons for the party's failure to have submitted the request before that time expired.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Manner of filings.</I> Pleadings and other communications shall be filed using the electronic filing system unless the Board permits otherwise. Documents submitted using that system are considered filed with the Board as of the date/time (Eastern Time) reflected in the system. Documents mailed to the Board are considered filed with the Board on the date mailed as evidenced by a United States postmark. Filings submitted by any other means are considered filed with the Board upon receipt by the Recorder of a complete copy of the filing during the Board's working hours (8:45 a.m.-4:45 p.m. Eastern Time).
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Service.</I> If both parties to an appeal are participating via the electronic filing system, separate service upon the opposing party is not required. Otherwise, documents shall be served personally or by mail with the opposing party by an equally or more expeditious means of transmittal, noting on the document filed with the Board, or on the transmitting letter, that a copy has been furnished. The filing of a document by fax transmission occurs upon receipt by the Board of the entire legible submission by fax. Copies of simultaneous briefs shall not be filed electronically or otherwise exchanged by the parties but rather shall be filed only with the Board by mail, fax, commercial carrier, on in-person. The Board will distribute simultaneous briefs electronically, or otherwise as appropriate. The Board may determine not to extend a deadline for filing if the extension is necessary solely because the Board's fax machine is busy or otherwise unavailable when a filing is due. Submissions filed by fax shall be followed promptly by filing by mail.

<HEAD>§ 955.13   Optional Small Claims (Expedited) and Accelerated Procedures.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>The Small Claims (Expedited) Procedure.</I> (1) The Expedited Procedure is available solely at the election of the appellant. Such election requires decision of the appeal, whenever possible, within 120 days after the Board receives written notice of the appellant's election to utilize this procedure.
</P>
<P>(2) The appellant may elect this procedure when:
</P>
<P>(i) There is a monetary amount in dispute and that amount is $50,000 or less, or
</P>
<P>(ii) There is a monetary amount in dispute and that amount is $150,000 or less and the appellant is a small business concern (as that term is defined in the Small Business Act and regulations promulgated under the Act).
</P>
<P>(3) In cases proceeding under the Expedited Procedure, the respondent shall file with the Board a copy of the contract, the contracting officer's final decision, and the appellant's claim letter or letters, if any, within ten days from the respondent's first receipt from either the appellant or the Board of a copy of the appellant's notice of election of the Expedited Procedure. If either party requests an oral hearing in accordance with § 955.9, the Board shall promptly schedule such a hearing for a mutually convenient time consistent with administrative due process and the 120-day limit for a decision, at a place determined under § 955.18. If a hearing is not requested by either party, the appeal shall be deemed to have been submitted under § 955.12 without a hearing.
</P>
<P>(4) Promptly after receipt of the appellant's election of the Expedited Procedure, the Board shall establish a schedule of proceedings that will allow for the timely resolution of the appeal. Pleadings, discovery, and other prehearing activities may be restricted or eliminated at the Board's discretion as necessary to enable the Board to decide the appeal within 120 days after the Board has received the appellant's notice of election of the Expedited Procedure. In so doing, the Board may reserve whatever time it considers necessary for preparation of the decision.
</P>
<P>(5) Written decisions by the Board in cases processed under the Expedited Procedure will be short and contain only summary findings of fact and conclusions. Decisions will be rendered for the Board by a single Judge. If there has been a hearing, the Judge presiding at the hearing may, in his or her discretion, at the conclusion of the hearing and after entertaining such oral arguments as he or she deems appropriate, render on the record oral summary findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a decision of the appeal. Whenever such an oral decision is rendered, the Board will subsequently furnish the parties a printed copy of such oral decision for the record and payment purposes and for the establishment of the commencement date of the period for filing a motion for reconsideration under § 955.30.
</P>
<P>(6) Decisions of the Board under the Expedited Procedure will not be published, will have no value as precedents, and in the absence of fraud, cannot be appealed.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>The Accelerated Procedure.</I> (1) The Accelerated Procedure is available solely at the election of the appellant and shall apply only to appeals where there is a monetary amount in dispute and the amount in dispute is $100,000 or less. Such election requires decision of the appeal, whenever possible, within 180 days after the Board receives written notice of the appellant's election to utilize this procedure.
</P>
<P>(2) Promptly after receipt of the appellant's election of the Accelerated Procedure, the Board shall establish a schedule of proceedings that will allow for the timely resolution of the appeal. The Board, in its discretion, may shorten time periods prescribed elsewhere in these Rules as necessary to enable the Board to decide the appeal within 180 days after the Board has received the appellant's notice of election of the Accelerated Procedure.
</P>
<P>(3) Written decisions by the Board in cases processed under the Accelerated Procedure will normally be short and contain only summary findings of fact and conclusions. Decisions will be rendered for the Board by a single Judge with the concurrence of the Chairman or Vice Chairman or other designated Judge, or by a majority among these two and an additional designated member in case of disagreement. In cases where the amount in dispute is $50,000 or less and in which there has been a hearing, the single Judge presiding at the hearing may, with the concurrence of both parties, convert the appeal to an Expedited Proceeding and at the conclusion of the hearing, after entertaining such oral arguments as he or she deems appropriate, render on the record oral summary findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a decision of the appeal. Whenever such an oral decision is rendered, the Board will subsequently furnish the parties a printed copy of such oral decision for record and payment purposes and to establish the date of commencement of the period for filing a motion for reconsideration under § 955.30.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Denial of election.</I> At the request of the respondent, or on its own initiative, the Board may determine whether the amount in dispute and/or the appellant's status make the election of the Expedited Procedure or the Accelerated Procedure inappropriate.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Motions for Reconsideration in Cases Arising Under § 955.13.</I> Motions for reconsideration of cases decided under either the Expedited Procedure or the Accelerated Procedure need not be decided within the time periods prescribed by this § 955.13 for the initial decision of the appeal, but all such motions shall be processed and decided rapidly so as to fulfill the intent of this section.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>General rule.</I> Except as herein modified, the rules of this Part 955 otherwise apply in all aspects.

<P>(a) The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures. In connection with any deposition or other discovery procedure, the Board may issue any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, and those orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place for discovery, and provisions for protecting the secrecy of confidential information or documents. Except in connection with motions to compel or for a protective order, discovery requests and responses should not be filed with the Board.
</P>
<P>(b)(1) The Board may limit the frequency or extent of use of discovery methods described in these rules. In doing so, generally the Board will consider whether:
</P>
<P>(i) The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;
</P>
<P>(ii) The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the case to obtain the information sought; or
</P>
<P>(iii) The discovery is unduly burdensome and expensive, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, limitations on the parties' resources, and the importance of the issues at stake.
</P>
<P>(2) The parties are required to make a good faith effort to resolve objections to discovery requests informally. A party receiving an objection to a discovery request, or a party which believes that another party's response to a discovery request is incomplete or entirely absent, may file a motion to compel a response, but such a motion must include a representation that the moving party has tried in good faith, prior to filing the motion, to resolve the matter informally. The motion to compel shall include a copy of each discovery request at issue and the response, if any.
</P>
<P>(c) If a party fails to appear for a deposition, after being served with a proper notice, or fails to serve answers or objections to interrogatories, requests for admission of facts, or requests for the production or inspection of documents, after proper service, the party seeking discovery may request that the Board impose appropriate rulings or sanctions.

<HEAD>§ 955.35   Subpoenas.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> Upon written request of either party filed with the Recorder, or on the Board's own initiative, the Board may issue a subpoena requiring:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Testimony at a deposition.</I> The deposing of a witness in the city or county where the witness resides or is employed or transacts business in person, or at another convenient location as determined by the Board;
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Testimony at a hearing.</I> The attendance of a witness for the purpose of taking testimony at a hearing; or
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Production of books and papers.</I> The production by a witness of books, papers, documents, electronically stored information, and other tangible and intangible things designated in the subpoena.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Voluntary cooperation.</I> Each party is expected:
</P>
<P>(1) To cooperate and make available witnesses and evidence under its control as requested by the other party, without issuance of a subpoena; and
</P>
<P>(2) To secure voluntary attendance of desired third-party witnesses, books, papers, documents, or tangible things whenever possible.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Requests for subpoenas.</I> (1) A request for a subpoena shall normally be filed at least:
</P>
<P>(i) 15 days before a scheduled deposition where the attendance of a witness at a deposition is sought, and/or where the production by a witness of books, papers, documents, electronically stored information, and other tangible and intangible things is sought; and
</P>
<P>(ii) 30 days before a scheduled hearing where the attendance of a witness at a hearing is sought; except that
</P>
<P>(iii) In its discretion the Board may honor requests for subpoenas not made within these time limitations.
</P>
<P>(2) A request for a subpoena shall state the reasonable scope and general relevance to the case of the testimony and of any books, papers, documents, electronically stored information, and other tangible and intangible things sought.
</P>
<P>(d)(1) <I>Requests to quash or modify.</I> Upon written request by the person subpoenaed or by a party, made within 10 days after service but in any event not later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, the Board may:
</P>
<P>(i) Quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive or for other good cause shown; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Require the person in whose behalf the subpoena was issued to advance the reasonable cost of compliance.
</P>
<P>(2) Where circumstances require, the Board may act upon such a request at any time after a copy has been served upon the opposing party.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Form; issuance.</I> (1) Every subpoena shall state the name of the Board and the title of the appeal and shall command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony, and where appropriate, to produce specified books, papers, documents, electronically stored information, and other tangible and intangible things at a time and place therein specified. In issuing a subpoena to a requesting party, the Judge shall sign the subpoena and may enter the name of the witness and otherwise leave it blank. The party to whom the subpoena is issued shall complete the subpoena before service.
</P>
<P>(2) Where the witness is located in a foreign country, a letter rogatory or subpoena may be issued and served under the circumstances and in the manner provided in 28 U.S.C. 1781-1784.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Service.</I> (1) The party requesting issuance of a subpoena shall arrange for service.
</P>
<P>(2) A subpoena may be served by a United States marshal or deputy marshal, or by any other person who is not a party and not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by personally delivering a copy to that person and tendering the fees for one day's attendance and the mileage provided by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable law.
</P>
<P>(3) The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be responsible for the payment of fees and mileage of the witness and of the officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such charges on demand may be deemed by the Board as a sufficient ground for striking the testimony of the witness and the evidence the witness has produced.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena.</I> In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena by a person who resides, is found, or transacts business within the jurisdiction of a U.S. District Court, the Board will apply to the Court through the Attorney General of the United States for an order requiring the person to appear before the Board or a member thereof to give testimony or produce evidence or both. Any failure of any such person to obey the order of the Court may be punished by the Court as a contempt thereof.

<HEAD>§ 958.12   Depositions; interrogatories; admission of facts; production and inspection of documents.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General policy and protective orders.</I> The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures. In connection with any discovery procedure permitted under this part, the Presiding Officer may issue any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. Such orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place for discovery, and provisions for protecting the secrecy of confidential information or documents. Each party shall bear its own expenses relating to discovery.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Depositions.</I> After the issuance of a Notice of Docketing and Hearing, the parties may mutually agree to, or the Presiding Officer may, upon application of either party and for good cause shown, order the taking of testimony of any person by deposition upon oral examination or written interrogatories before any officer authorized to administer oaths at the place of examination, for use as evidence or for purposes of discovery. The application for an order of the Presiding Officer under this paragraph shall specify whether the purpose of the deposition is discovery or for use as evidence.
</P>
<P>(1) The time, place, and manner of taking depositions shall be as mutually agreed by the parties, or failing such agreement, governed by order of the Presiding Officer.
</P>
<P>(2) No testimony taken by depositions shall be considered as part of the record in the hearing unless and until such testimony is offered and received into evidence by order of the Presiding Officer. Deposition testimony will not ordinarily be received in evidence if an oral hearing is requested by either party, and the deponent is available to testify personally at the hearing. In such instances, however, deposition testimony may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the witness given at the hearing. In cases submitted for a decision on a written record, the Presiding Officer may, in his or her discretion, receive deposition testimony as evidence in supplementation of that record.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Interrogatories to parties.</I> After the issuance of a Notice of Docketing and Hearing, a party may serve on the other party written interrogatories. Within 30 days after service, the party served shall answer each interrogatory separately in writing, signed under oath, or file objections thereto. Upon timely objection by the party, the Presiding Officer will determine the extent to which the interrogatories will be permitted.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Admission of facts.</I> After the issuance of a Notice of Docketing and Hearing, a party may serve upon the other party a request for the admission of specified facts. Within 30 days after service, the party served shall answer each requested fact or file objections thereto. Upon timely objection by the party, the Presiding Officer will determine the extent to which the request for admission will be permitted. The factual propositions set out in the request shall be deemed admitted upon the failure of a party to respond to the request for admission.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Production and inspection of documents.</I> Upon motion of a party showing good cause therefor, and upon notice, the Presiding Officer may order the other party to produce and permit the inspection and copying or photographing of any designated documents or objects, not privileged, specifically identified, and their relevance and materiality to the cause or causes in issue explained, which are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery or admissible evidence. If the parties cannot themselves agree thereon, the Presiding Officer shall specify just terms and conditions in making the inspection and taking the copies and photographs.
</P>

<HEAD>§ 960.1   Purpose of these rules.</HEAD>
<P>The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called “the Act” in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary adjudications”) before the Postal Service. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Postal Service, unless the Postal Service's position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Postal Service will use to make them.

<P>(2) Appeals of decisions of contracting officers made pursuant to section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605) before the Postal Service Board of Contract Appeals as provided in section 8 of that Act. (41 U.S.C. 607). 
</P>
<P>(b) The Postal Service may also designate a proceeding not listed in paragraph (a) of this section as an adversary adjudication for purposes of the Act by so stating in an order initiating the proceeding or designating the matter for hearing. The failure to designate a proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in proceedings on the application.

<HEAD>§ 960.4   Eligibility of applicants.</HEAD>
<P>(a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term “party” is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show by clear and convincing evidence that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B and must submit additional information to verify its eligibility upon order by the adjudicative officer.
</P>
<P>(b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;
</P>
<P>(2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees; 
</P>
<P>(3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;
</P>
<P>(4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees; and
</P>
<P>(5) Any other partnerships, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.
</P>
<P>(c) For the purposes of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated, which in proceedings before the Board of Contract Appeals is the date the applicant files its appeal to the Board. 
</P>
<P>(d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.
</P>
<P>(e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.
</P>
<P>(f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
</P>
<P>(g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.

However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.
</P>
<P>(c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent or expert witness, the adjudicative officer shall consider the following:
</P>
<P>(1) If the attorney, agent or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;

<HEAD>§ 962.12   Depositions; interrogatories; admission of facts; production and inspection of documents.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General Policy and protective orders.</I> The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures. In connection with any discovery procedure permitted under this part, the Presiding Officer may issue any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. Such orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place for discovery, and provisions for protecting the secrecy of confidential information or documents. Each party shall bear its own expenses relating to discovery.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Depositions.</I> (1) After the issuance of a Notice of Hearing described in § 962.6, the parties may mutually agree to, or the Presiding Officer may, upon application of either party and for good cause shown, order the taking of testimony of any person by deposition upon oral examination or written interrogatories before any officer authorized to administer oaths at the place of examination, for use as evidence or for purposes of discovery. The application for order shall specify whether the purpose of the deposition is discovery or for use as evidence.
</P>
<P>(2) The time, place, and manner of taking depositions shall be as mutually agreed by the parties, or failing such agreement, governed by order of the Presiding Officer.
</P>
<P>(3) No testimony taken by depositions shall be considered as part of the evidence in the hearing unless and until such testimony is offered and received in evidence at such hearing. Depositions will not ordinarily be received in evidence if the deponent is present and can testify personally at the hearing. In such instances, however, the deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the witness given at the hearing. In cases submitted for a decision on the record, the Presiding Officer may, in his discretion, receive depositions as evidence in supplementation of that record.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Interrogatories to parties.</I> After the issuance of a Notice of Hearing described in § 962.6, a party may serve on the other party written interrogatories to be answered separately in writing, signed under oath and returned within 30 days. Upon timely objection by the party, the Presiding Officer will determine the extent to which the interrogatories will be permitted.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Admission of facts.</I> After the issuance of a Notice of Hearing described in § 962.6, a party may serve upon the other party a request for the admission of specified facts. Within 30 days after service, the party served shall answer each requested fact or file objections thereto. The factual propositions set out in the request shall be deemed admitted upon the failure of a party to respond to the request for admission.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Production and inspection of documents.</I> Upon motion of any party showing good cause therefor, and upon notice, the Presiding Officer may order the other party to produce and permit the inspection and copying or photographing of any designated documents or objects, not privileged, specifically identified, and their relevance and materiality to the cause or causes in issue explained, which are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery or admissible evidence. If the parties cannot themselves agree thereon, the Presiding Officer shall specify just terms and conditions in making the inspection and taking the copies and photographs.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Limitations.</I> Under no circumstances may a discovery procedure be used to reach
</P>
<P>(1) Documents, transcripts, records, or other material which a person is not entitled to review pursuant to § 962.11;

<HEAD>§ 962.13   Subpoenas.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General.</I> Upon written request of either party filed with the Recorder or on his own initiative, the Presiding Officer may issue a subpoena requiring:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Testimony at a deposition.</I> The deposing of a witness in the city or county where he resides or is employed or transacts his business in person, or at another location convenient for him that is specifically determined by the Presiding Officer;
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Testimony at a hearing.</I> The attendance of a witness for the purpose of taking testimony at a hearing; and 
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Production of books and papers.</I> In addition to paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, the production by the witness at the deposition or hearing of books and papers designated in the subpoena.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Voluntary cooperation.</I> Each party is expected (1) to cooperate and make available witnesses and evidence under its control as requested by the other party, without issuance of a subpoena, and (2) to secure voluntary attendance of desired third-party books, papers, documents, or other tangible things whenever possible.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Requests for subpoenas.</I> (1) A request for a subpoena shall normally be filed at least:
</P>
<P>(i) 15 days before a scheduled deposition where the attendance of a witness at a deposition is sought;
</P>
<P>(ii) 30 days before a scheduled hearing where the attendance of a witness at a hearing is sought.
</P>
<P>(2) A request for a subpoena shall state the reasonable scope and general relevance to the case of the testimony and of any books, papers, documents, or other tangible things sought.
</P>
<P>(3) The Presiding Officer, in his discretion, may honor requests for subpoenas not made within the time limitations specified in this paragraph.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Requests to quash or modify.</I> Upon written request by the person subpoenaed or by a party, made within 10 days after service but in any event not later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, the Presiding Officer may (1) quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive or for other good cause shown, or (2) require the person in whose behalf the subpoena was issued to advance the reasonable cost of producing subpoenaed books and papers. Where circumstances require, the Presiding Officer may act upon such a request at any time after a copy has been served upon the opposing party.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Form; issuance.</I> (1) Every subpoena shall state the title of the proceeding, shall cite 31 U.S.C. 3804(b) as the authority under which it is issued, and shall command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony, and if appropriate, to produce specified books and papers at a time and place therein specified. In issuing a subpoena to a requesting party, the Presiding Officer shall sign the subpoena and may, in his discretion, enter the name of the witness and otherwise leave it blank. The party to whom the subpoena is issued shall complete the subpoena before service. 
</P>
<P>(2) Where the witness is located in a foreign country, a letter rogatory or subpoena may be issued and served under the circumstances and in the manner provided in 28 U.S.C. 1781-1784.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Service.</I> (1) The party requesting issuance of a subpoena shall arrange for service.
</P>
<P>(2) A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition or hearing may be served at any place. A subpoena may be served by a United States marshal or deputy marshal, or by any other person who is not a party and not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by personally delivering a copy to that person and tendering the fees for one day's attendance and the mileage provided by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable law.
</P>
<P>(3) The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be responsible for the payment of fees and mileage of the witness and of the officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such charges on demand may be deemed by the Presiding Officer as sufficient ground for striking the testimony of the witness and the evidence the witness has produced.

<HEAD>§ 963.3   Petition; notice of hearing; answer; filing and copies of documents; summary judgment.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Petition.</I> Anyone against whom a complaint has been issued pursuant to 39 U.S.C 3008(d) may submit to the Manager a petition for hearing on the alleged violation. The petition must be in writing, signed by the petitioner or his or her attorney, and filed with the Manager on or before the 15th day after receipt of the complaint. The petition shall state the reasons why the petitioner believes the complaint to be erroneous. No petition received after the 15th day will be considered to have been filed on time, unless it was duly sent to the Manager via certified mail, deposited in the U.S. mail on or before the 15th day. The Manager will forward each timely petition to the Recorder through the Judicial Officer Department electronic filing system at <I>https://usps-judicialoffice.journaltech.com</I>.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Notice of hearing.</I> Upon receiving a petition, the Recorder shall schedule a hearing for a date not later than 30 days after the date of receipt, issue and send a notice of hearing to the parties, and send a copy of the petition to the General Counsel of the U.S. Postal Service. 
</P>

The Recorder shall maintain a docket and the files in all proceedings.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Summary Judgment.</I> Upon motion of either the General Counsel or the petitioner, or on his or her own initiative, the presiding officer may find that the petition and answer present no genuine and material issues of fact requiring an evidentiary hearing, and thereupon may render an initial decision upholding or dismissing the complaint. The initial decision shall become the final agency decision if a timely appeal is not taken.

</P>
<HD1>code of ethics for government service
</HD1>
<P>Any person in Government service should: 
</P>
<P>1. Put loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, party, or Government department. 
</P>
<P>2. Uphold the Constitution, laws, and legal regulations of the United States and of all governments therein and never be a party to their evasion. 
</P>
<P>3. Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay; giving to the performance of his duties his earnest effort and best thought. 
</P>
<P>4. Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of getting tasks accomplished. 
</P>
<P>5. Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not; and never accept, for himself or his family, favors or benefits under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of his governmental duties. 
</P>
<P>6. Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of office, since a Government employee has no private word which can be binding on public duty. 
</P>
<P>7. Engage in no business with the Government, either directly or indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of his governmental duties. 
</P>
<P>8. Never use any information coming to him confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means for making private profit. 
</P>
<P>9. Expose corruption wherever discovered. 
</P>
<P>10. Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a public trust.

<P>(c) <I>Content of request.</I> Each request must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable Commission personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, the request should include specific information about each record sought that might assist the Commission in responding to the request, such as the type of record (<I>e.g.,</I> contract, report, memorandum, etc.); the title or docket number of a specific document or report; the topic or subject matter; the name of the office and/or employees most likely to possess the record; the date or general timeframe of the record's creation; and any details related to the purpose of the record. Requests for email records should specify the likely senders and recipients, keywords, and a range of dates. Before submitting requests, a requester may contact the Chief FOIA Officer (or the individual's designee) or the FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records sought and to receive assistance in describing the records. The request may also specify the requester's preferred method of communication (telephone, email, or mailing address) and the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) of the requested records.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Improper requests.</I> A request that does not reasonably describe the records sought or does not comply with the published rules regarding the procedures to be followed for submitting a request will be deemed to be an improper FOIA request. If the Commission does not receive the additional information needed that reasonably describes the records to enable their location by the Commission with a reasonable amount of effort, then the Commission will administratively close the file.
</P>
<P>(1) If after receiving a request, the Commission determines that it is improper, the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee will provide one written notification to the requester using the contact information included in the request. The notification will inform the requester of all the following:
</P>
<P>(i) The reason(s) why the request is improper;
</P>
<P>(ii) The additional information needed from the requester that would reasonably describe the records to enable their location by the Commission with a reasonable amount of effort;
</P>
<P>(iii) The Commission will not be able to comply with the request unless the Commission receives such additional information in writing within the specified timeframe and if the Commission does not receive a written response containing the additional information needed within the specified timeframe, then it will presume that the requester is no longer interested in the records and will administratively close the file on the request;
</P>
<P>(iv) The preferred method for the requester to provide the additional information is by emailing <I>FOIA@prc.gov;</I>
</P>
<P>(v) The requester may also provide the additional information by mailing or by hand delivery during regular business hours (which are from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time, except for Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) to the Office of Secretary and Administration, Postal Regulatory Commission, 901 New York Avenue NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20268-0001); and
</P>
<P>(vi) The contact information for the Chief FOIA Officer (or the individual's designee) and the FOIA Public Liaison, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought.
</P>
<P>(2) If the requester provides the additional information needed that reasonably describes the records to enable their location by the Commission with a reasonable amount of effort by the timeframe specified in the notification, then the Commission will confirm receipt of the information and process the request.
</P>
<P>(3) After administrative closure, if the Commission receives the additional information needed that reasonably describes the records to enable their location by the Commission with a reasonable amount of effort, then the Commission will notify the requester that the request will be processed as a new request.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Expedited processing.</I> At any time, a requester that has satisfied all applicable requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section may seek expedited processing of a request or an administrative appeal. To seek expedited processing, the requester must:
</P>
<P>(1) Include “Expedited Freedom of Information Act Request” or “Expedited Freedom of Information Act Appeal” in the body of the submission;
</P>
<P>(2) For any hard copy submission, include “Expedited Freedom of Information Act Request” or “Expedited Freedom of Information Act Appeal” on the envelope;
</P>
<P>(3) Demonstrate a compelling need as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(E)(v); and
</P>
<P>(4) Certify the statement of compelling need to be true and correct to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief. The Commission has discretion to waive the certification requirement.

<HEAD>§ 3006.201   Timing of responses to requests.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>In general.</I> Requests will ordinarily be responded to according to their order of receipt.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Multitrack processing.</I> (1) Unless expedited processing has been granted, the Commission places each request in simple or complex tracks based on the amount of work and time involved in processing the request. Factors considered in assigning a request into the complex track may include one or more of the following:
</P>
<P>(i) The request involves voluminous documents;
</P>
<P>(ii) The complexity of the material;
</P>
<P>(iii) The request involves record searches at multiple facilities or locations;
</P>
<P>(iv) The request requires consultation among the Commission or other agencies; or
</P>
<P>(v) The number of open requests submitted by the same requester.
</P>
<P>(2) Within each track, the Commission processes requests in the order in which they are received. When appropriate, the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee will notify the requester of placing a request in the “Complex” track and provide the requester with an opportunity to limit the scope of the request. If the requester limits the scope of the request, it may result in faster processing.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Expedited processing.</I> (1) Requests and appeals shall be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve the following:
</P>
<P>(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or
</P>
<P>(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information.
</P>
<P>(2) Within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing, the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee will notify the requester of the decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and shall be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee will inform the requester of the denial in writing, the right to appeal the denial to the Commission in writing, and the procedures for appealing the denial. Any request for records that has been denied expedited processing will be processed in the same manner as a request that did not seek expedited processing.
</P>
<P>(3) Where a compelling need is not shown in an expedited request as specified in § 3006.200(e), the Commission may grant the request for expedited processing at its discretion.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Unusual circumstances.</I> Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances”, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(iii), and the Commission extends the time limit on that basis, the Commission shall, before the expiration of the 20 business day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. If an extension will exceed 10 business days, the Commission will:
</P>
<P>(1) Provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative timeframe for processing; and
</P>
<P>(2) Make its FOIA Public Liaison available to the requester and apprise the requester of their right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Aggregating requests.</I> For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, the Commission may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a single requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. Multiple requests that involve unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.

<DIV8 N="§ 3006.202" NODE="39:1.0.2.16.4.2.1.3" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 3006.202   Responses to requests.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>In general.</I> To the extent practicable and unless the request indicates a different preferred method of communication, the Commission will communicate with the requester electronically (such as via email). In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Commission will include only records in its possession and control on the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the Commission shall inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to the request.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Acknowledgments of requests.</I> The Commission shall acknowledge the request and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) to process. The acknowledgment must include a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to keep track of their requests more easily.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Grants of requests.</I> Once the Commission makes a determination to grant a request in full or in part, the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee shall notify the requester in writing. The Commission also shall inform the requester of any fees charged and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The Commission must inform the requester of the availability of the FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Adverse determinations of requests.</I> If the Commission makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, then the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Content of denials.</I> The denial shall be signed by the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee and shall include:
</P>
<P>(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;
</P>
<P>(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the Commission in denying the request;
</P>
<P>(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;
</P>
<P>(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 3006.203, and a description of the requirements; and
</P>
<P>(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the Commission's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by the Office of Government Information Services.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Markings on released documents.</I> Markings on released documents must be clearly visible to the requester. Records disclosed in part shall be marked to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted shall also be indicated on the record, if technically feasible.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Use of record exclusions.</I> (1) If the Commission identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), the Commission must confer with the Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy (OIP), to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.
</P>
<P>(2) Upon invoking an exclusion, the Commission must maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of exclusion by OIP.

<HEAD>§ 3006.203   Appeals.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Discretionary review.</I> The Commission (on its own initiative) may review any decision of the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee within 90 calendar days.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Requirements for making an appeal.</I> A requester may appeal an adverse decision on their FOIA request rendered by the Commission by submitting a hard copy to the Commission's office (901 New York Avenue NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20268-0001) or by emailing <I>FOIA@prc.gov.</I> The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days after the date of the Commission's response. To facilitate handling, the requester must mark both the appeal letter and envelope or the subject line of the electronic transmission “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.” The appeal must include, as applicable:
</P>
<P>(1) A copy of the request, of any notification of denial or other action, and of any other related correspondence;
</P>
<P>(2) The FOIA tracking number assigned to the request;
</P>
<P>(3) A description of the action (or failure to act) which is being challenged;
</P>
<P>(4) If challenging specific redactions made to responsive records, a statement identifying the specific redactions being challenged;
</P>
<P>(5) A statement of the relief sought; and
</P>
<P>(6) A statement of the reasons why the requester believes the action or failure to act is erroneous.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Adjudication of appeals.</I> (1) The decision of the Commission constitutes the final decision on the issue being appealed. The Commission will give prompt consideration to an appeal for expedited processing of a request. All other decisions normally will be made within 20 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) from the time of the receipt by the Commission. The 20-business day response period may be extended by the Commission for a period not to exceed an additional 10 business days when reasonably necessary to permit the proper consideration of an appeal, under one or more of the “unusual circumstances”, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(iii). The aggregate number of additional business days used, however, may not exceed 10 business days.
</P>
<P>(2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.
</P>
<P>(3) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the Commission must take appropriate action to ensure compliance with applicable classification rules.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Decisions on appeals.</I> A decision on an appeal must be made in writing. A decision that upholds the adverse determination in whole or in part will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If the adverse determination is remanded or modified on appeal, the requester will be notified in writing and the Chief FOIA Officer or the individual's designee will further process the request in accordance with that appellate decision and respond directly to the requester. If not prohibited by or under law, the Commission may direct the disclosure of a record even though its disclosure is not required by law or regulation.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by OGIS.</I> Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If the Commission agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>When an appeal is required.</I> Before seeking judicial review of an adverse determination rendered by the Commission on a FOIA request, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.

<HEAD>§ 3006.204   Relationship among the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, and the Commission's procedures for according appropriate confidentiality.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Coverage.</I> FOIA applies to all Commission records and provides the public with access to government records.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Requesting records subject to the Privacy Act.</I> A request by an individual for the individual's own records contained in a system of records is governed by the Privacy Act. Release will first be considered under the Privacy Act pursuant to part 3005 of this chapter. However, if there is any record that the Commission need not release under the Privacy Act, the Commission will also consider the request under FOIA, and will release the record if FOIA requires it.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Requesting another individual's record.</I> Request for records of individuals which may not be granted under the Privacy Act shall be considered under FOIA.
</P>
<P>(1) If the Commission makes a disclosure in response to a request and the disclosure is permitted by the Privacy Act's disclosure provision, 5 U.S.C. 552a(b), the Commission will rely on the Privacy Act to govern the disclosure.
</P>
<P>(2) In some circumstances, the Privacy Act may prohibit the Commission's ability to release records which may be released under FOIA.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Requesting a Postal Service record.</I> The Commission maintains custody of records that are both Commission and Postal Service records. Except when the Postal Service submits materials to the Commission in connection with activities under 39 U.S.C. 407(b)(2)(A), in all other instances that the Postal Service submits materials to the Commission that the Postal Service reasonably believes to be exempt from public disclosure, the Postal Service shall follow the procedures described in part 3011, subpart B of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(1) A request made pursuant to FOIA for Postal Service records shall be referred to the Postal Service; and
</P>
<P>(2) A request made pursuant to part 3011 of this chapter for records designated as non-public by the Postal Service shall be considered under the applicable standards set forth in that part.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Requesting a record submitted by a person other than the Postal Service.</I> The Commission maintains records of a confidential nature submitted by persons other than the Postal Service as non-public materials.
</P>
<P>(1) A request made pursuant to FOIA for records submitted by a person other than the Postal Service shall adhere to the applicable procedures of § 3006.205. If such a FOIA request is not referred to a different Federal agency pursuant to § 3006.205(b), the Commission shall consider it in light of all applicable exemptions and in accordance with the following procedures:
</P>
<P>(i) If such materials are designated as non-public, the Commission shall follow the procedures appearing in § 3006.206(b) through (d) in determining the FOIA request; or
</P>
<P>(ii) In all other instances, the Commission shall determine the FOIA request after notifying the person of the FOIA request and providing the person with an opportunity to respond within 7 days of the date of the notice under the following circumstances:
</P>
<P>(A) The records sought contain confidential commercial information that may be protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4); and
</P>
<P>(B) The Commission determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided that at least one of the following applies:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4); or
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) The Commission has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.
</P>
<P>(2) A request made pursuant to part 3011 of this chapter for records designated as non-public by a person other than the Postal Service shall be considered under the applicable standards set forth in that part.

<DIV8 N="§ 3006.205" NODE="39:1.0.2.16.4.2.1.6" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 3006.205   Consultations, referrals, and coordinations.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Consultations.</I> If records originated with the Commission but contain within them information of significance to another Federal agency or office, the Commission will typically consult with that other entity prior to making a release determination.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Referrals.</I> In addition to referring all requests made pursuant to FOIA for Postal Service records to the Postal Service as specified by § 3006.204(d)(1), if the Commission believes that a different Federal agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the Commission will typically refer responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. Whenever the Commission refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, the Commission will notify the requester of the referral, including the name of the agency and that agency's FOIA contact information.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Coordinations.</I> The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the Federal agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law enforcement agency responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if the Commission locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the Commission will coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on disclosure of the record. The Commission then will notify the requester of the release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Classified information.</I> On receipt of any request involving classified information, the Commission will determine whether the information is currently and properly classified in accordance with applicable classification rules. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the Commission must refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever an agency's record contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another agency), the Commission must refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Timing of responses to consultations and referrals.</I> All consultations and referrals received by the Commission will be handled according to the date that the first agency received the perfected FOIA request.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Agreements regarding consultations and referrals.</I> The Commission may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.

<P>(a) <I>Overlap with treatment of non-public materials.</I> Any person who submits materials to the Commission (submitter) that the submitter reasonably believes to be exempt from public disclosure shall follow the procedures described in part 3011, subpart B of this chapter, except when the submitter submits materials to the Commission in connection with activities under 39 U.S.C. 407(b)(2)(A).
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Notice of request.</I> Except as provided in § 3006.204(d), if a FOIA request seeks materials designated as non-public materials, the Commission will provide the submitter with notice of the request. The Commission may also provide notice when it has reason to believe that materials submitted by a person other than the Postal Service are possibly exempt from disclosure and may fall within the scope of any FOIA request.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Objections to disclosure.</I> A submitter may file written objections to the request specifying all grounds for withholding the information under FOIA within 7 days of the date of the notice. If the submitter fails to respond to the notice, the submitter will be considered to have no objection, beyond those objections articulated in its application for non-public treatment pursuant to § 3011.201 of this chapter, to the disclosure of the information.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Notice of decision.</I> If, after considering the submitter's objections to disclosure the Commission decides to disclose the information, it will give the submitter written notice of the decision and a brief explanation of the reasons for not sustaining the submitter's objections. The actual disclosure will not be made before 3 days after publication of the Commission's decision.

</P>
<P>(b) <I>Direct costs</I> means the expenditures the Commission incurs in searching for, duplicating, and, where applicable, reviewing documents to respond to a request. They include (without limitation) the salary of the employee(s) performing work (the basic pay rate of such employee(s) plus 16 percent to cover benefits).

These examples are not all inclusive and may include alternate media to disseminate news. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity (<I>e.g.,</I> by a publication contract or prior publication record), whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity.
</P>

<P>(b) Except in the case of commercial use requesters, the first 100 pages of duplication and the first 2 hours of search time are provided without charge.
</P>
<P>(1) A page for these purposes is a letter- or legal-size sheet, or the equivalent amount of information in a medium other than paper copy.
</P>
<P>(2) Search time for these purposes refers to manual searching; if the search is performed by computer, the 2 hours provided without charge will be equal to 2 hours' salary of the person performing the search.
</P>
<P>(c) No requester will be charged a fee when the Commission determines that the cost of collecting the fee would equal or exceed the fee itself. In determining whether cost of collection would equal or exceed the fee, the allowance for 2 hours' search or 100 pages of duplication will be made before comparing the remaining fee and the cost of collection.
</P>
<P>(d) Records will be provided without charge or at a reduced charge if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
</P>
<P>(e) No requester will be charged a fee after any search or response which occurs after the applicable time limits as described in §§ 3006.202 and 3006.203, unless:
</P>
<P>(1) The Commission extends the time limit for its response due to unusual circumstances, pursuant to § 3006.201(d), and the Commission completes its response within the extension of time provided under that section; or
</P>
<P>(2) The Commission extends the time limit for its response due to unusual circumstances and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request and the Commission has discussed with the requester how they could effectively limit the scope of the request or made at least three good faith attempts to do so; or
</P>
<P>(3) A court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist and excused the Commission from responding by court order.
</P>
<P>(f) The Commission may, however, charge fees for review, and in some cases duplication, for a partial grant of a request while it reviews records that may be exempt and may be responsive to the request, so long as the partial grant is made within the applicable time limits.

<HEAD>§ 3006.303   Fee schedule.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Fees will be calculated as follows:
</P>
<P>(1) <I>Manual search.</I> At the salary rate (basic pay plus 16 percent) of the employee(s) making the search. Search time may be charged for even if the Commission fails to locate records or if records located are exempt from disclosure.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Computer search.</I> At the direct cost of providing the search, including computer search time directly attributable to searching for records responsive to the request runs and employee salary apportionable to the search.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Review (commercial use).</I> At the salary rate (basic pay plus 16 percent) of the employee(s) conducting the review. Charges are imposed only for the review necessary at the initial administrative level to determine the applicability of any exemption, and not for review at the administrative appeal level of an exemption already applied.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Duplication.</I> At 10 cents per page for paper copy, which the Commission has found to be the reasonable direct cost thereof. For copies of records prepared by computer the direct cost of production, including employee time, will be charged.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Additional services.</I> Postage, insurance, and other additional services that may be arranged for by the requester will be charged at actually incurred cost.

<P>(a) Advance payment may be required if the requester failed to pay previous bills in a timely fashion or when the fees are likely to exceed $250.
</P>
<P>(1) Where the requester has previously failed to pay within 30 days of the billing date, the Commission may require the requester to pay an advance payment of the estimated fee together with either the past due fees (plus applicable interest) or proof that the past fees were paid.
</P>
<P>(2) When advance payment is required, the administrative time limits prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) (§ 3006.201) begin only after such payment has been received.

<HEAD>§ 3007.100   Public access to Commission meetings.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Definition. Commission meeting</I> means the deliberations of at least three Commissioners where such deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of official Commission business.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Open Commission meetings.</I> (1) Commissioners shall not jointly conduct or dispose of agency business other than in accordance with this section. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, every portion of every meeting of the Commission shall be open to public observation.
</P>
<P>(2) Members of the public may not participate in open meetings. They may record the proceedings, provided they use battery-operated recording devices at their seats. Cameras may be used by observers to photograph proceedings, provided it is done from their seats and no flash or lighting equipment is used. Persons may electronically record or photograph a meeting, as long as such activity does not impede or disturb the members of the Commission in the performance of their duties, or members of the public attempting to observe, or to record or photograph, the Commission meeting.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Physical arrangements for open meetings.</I> The Secretary shall be responsible for seeing that ample space, sufficient visibility, and adequate acoustics are provided for public observation of the Commission meetings.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Closed Commission meetings.</I> Except in a case where the Commission finds that the public interest requires otherwise, the second sentence of paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply to any portion of a Commission meeting, and the requirements of paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section shall not apply to any information pertaining to such meeting otherwise required by this section to be disclosed to the public, where the Commission properly determines that such portion or portions of its meetings or the disclosure of such information is likely to:
</P>
<P>(1) Disclose matters that:
</P>
<P>(i) Are specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or foreign policy; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.
</P>
<P>(2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Commission;
</P>
<P>(3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552), provided that such statute:
</P>
<P>(i) Requires the matter to be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.
</P>
<P>(4) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
</P>
<P>(5) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;
</P>
<P>(6) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
</P>
<P>(7) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would:
</P>
<P>(i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;
</P>
<P>(ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;
</P>
<P>(iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
</P>
<P>(iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source;
</P>
<P>(v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; or
</P>
<P>(vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>(8) Disclose information contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions;
</P>
<P>(9) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed Commission action, except that this paragraph (d)(9) shall not apply in any instance where the Commission has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action, or where the Commission is required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final Commission action on such proposal; or
</P>
<P>(10) Specifically concern the Commission's issuance of a subpoena or the Commission's participation in a civil action or appellate proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct or disposition by the Commission of a particular case of formal Commission adjudication pursuant to the procedures in 5 U.S.C. 554 or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Procedures for closing meetings.</I> (1) Action under paragraph (d) of this section shall be taken only when three Commissioners vote to take such action. A separate vote of the Commissioners shall be taken with respect to each agency meeting a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, or with respect to any information which is proposed to be withheld under paragraph (d) of this section. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than 30 days after the initial meeting in such series. The vote of each Commissioner participating in such vote shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.
</P>
<P>(2) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the Commission close such portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in paragraph (d)(5), (6), or (7) of this section, the Commission upon request of any one of its members, shall vote by recorded vote whether to close such meeting.
</P>
<P>(3) Within one day of any vote taken pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section, the Commission shall make publicly available a written copy of such vote reflecting the vote of each member on the question. If a portion of a meeting is to be closed to the public, the Commission shall, within one day of the vote taken pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section, make publicly available a full written explanation of its action closing the portion together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation.
</P>
<P>(4) Any person may protest a Commission decision to hold a closed meeting under paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section by filing a motion to open the meeting. Such motion shall be addressed to the Commission and shall set forth with particularity the statutory or other authority relied upon, the reasons for which the movant believes the meeting should not be closed, and the reasons for which the movant believes that the public interest requires the meeting to be open. Such motion shall be filed with the Secretary no later than 24 hours prior to the time for which the closed meeting is scheduled.
</P>
<P>(5) The Commission has determined that a majority of its meetings may be closed to the public pursuant to paragraph (d)(4), (8), or (10) of this section or any combination thereof. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552b(d)(4), Commission meetings shall be closed to the public pursuant to paragraph (d)(4), (8), or (10) of this section or any combination thereof when three Commissioners vote by recorded vote at the beginning of such meeting, or portion thereof, to close the exempt portion or portions of the meeting, and a copy of such vote, reflecting the vote of each Commissioner on the question, is made available to the public. The provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) and (f) of this section shall not apply to any portion of a meeting to which paragraph (e)(5) of this section applies: Provided, that the Commission shall, except to the extent that such information is exempt from disclosure under the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, provide the public with public announcement of the time, place, and subject matter of the meeting and of each portion thereof at the earliest practicable time.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Scheduling and public announcement.</I> (1) In the case of each meeting, the Commission shall make public announcement, at least one week before the meeting, of the time, place, and subject matter of the meeting, whether it is to be open or closed to the public, and the name and phone number of the official designated by the Commission to respond to requests for information about the meeting. Such announcement shall be made unless three Commissioners determine by a recorded vote that Commission business requires that such meeting be called at an earlier date, in which case the Commission shall make public announcement of the time, place, and subject matter of such meeting, and whether open or closed to the public, at the earliest practicable time.
</P>
<P>(2) The time or place of a meeting may be changed following the public announcement required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section only if the Commission publicly announces such change at the earliest practicable time. The subject matter of a meeting, or the determination of the Commission to open or close a meeting, or a portion of a meeting, to the public, may be changed following the public announcement required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section only if:
</P>
<P>(i) Three Commissioners determine by a recorded vote that Commission business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible; and
</P>
<P>(ii) The Commission publicly announces such change and the vote of each Commissioner upon such change at the earliest practicable time.
</P>
<P>(3) Immediately following each public announcement required by this paragraph (f), notice of the time, place, and subject matter of a meeting, whether the meeting is open or closed, any change in one of the preceding, and the name and phone number of the official designated by the Commission to respond to requests for information about the meeting, shall also be submitted for publication in the <E T="04">Federal Register</E>.
</P>
<P>(4) The public announcement required by this section may consist of the Secretary:
</P>
<P>(i) Publicly posting a copy of the document in the reception area of the Postal Regulatory Commission located at 901 New York Avenue NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20268-0001;
</P>
<P>(ii) Mailing a copy to all persons whose names are on a mailing list maintained for this purpose;
</P>
<P>(iii) Operating a recorded telephone announcement, giving the announcement; and
</P>
<P>(iv) Any other means which the Secretary believes will serve to further inform any persons who might be interested.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Certification of closed meetings; transcripts, electronic recordings, and minutes.</I> (1) Before any meeting to be closed pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) through (10) of this section, the General Counsel of the Commission, or in the General Counsel's absence, the senior advisory staff attorney available, should publicly certify that, in the individual's opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall state each relevant exemptive provision. A copy of such certification, together with a statement from the presiding officer of the meeting setting forth the time and place of the meeting, and the persons present, shall be retained by the Commission. The Commission shall maintain a complete transcript or electronic recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, except that in the case of a meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public pursuant to paragraph (d)(8) or (10) of this section, the Commission shall maintain either such a transcript or recording, or a set of minutes. Such minutes shall fully and clearly describe all matters discussed and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons therefor, including a description of the views expressed on any item and the record of any rollcall vote (reflecting the vote of each Commissioner on the question). All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such minutes.
</P>
<P>(2) The Commission shall make promptly available to the public, in a place easily accessible to the public, the transcript, electronic recording, or minutes (as required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section) of the discussion of any item on the agenda, or of any item of the testimony of any witness received at the meeting, except for such item or items of such discussion or testimony as the Commission determines by a majority vote of all its members contains information which may be withheld under paragraph (d) of this section, and is not required by the public interest to be made available. Copies of such transcript, or minutes, or a transcription of such recording disclosing the identity of each speaker, shall be furnished to any person at the actual cost of duplication or transcription. The Commission shall maintain a complete verbatim copy of the transcript, a complete copy of the minutes, or a complete electronic recording of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, for a period of at least two years after such meeting, or until one year after the conclusion of any Commission proceeding with respect to which the meeting or portion was held, whichever occurs later.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Requests to open or close Commission meetings.</I> (1)(i) Any person may request in writing that the Commission open to public observation discussion of a matter which it has earlier decided to close.
</P>
<P>(ii) Such requests shall be captioned “Request to open ____ (date) Commission meeting on item ____ (number or description).” The request shall state the reason(s) therefor, the name and address of the person making the request and, if desired, a telephone number.
</P>
<P>(iii) Ten copies of such requests must be received by the Office of Secretary and Administration no later than three working days after the issuance of the notice of meeting to which the request pertains. Requests received after that time will be returned to the requester with a statement that the request was untimely received and that copies of any nonexempt portions of the transcript or minutes for the meeting in question will ordinarily be available in the Office of Secretary and Administration ten working days after the meeting.
</P>
<P>(2)(i) Any person whose interests may be directly affected may request in writing that the Commission close to public observation discussion of a matter which it has earlier decided to open as provided for in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
</P>
<P>(ii) Such requests shall be captioned “Request to Close ____ (date) Commission meeting on item ____ (number or description),” shall state the reason(s) therefor, the name and address of the person making the request and, if desired, a telephone number.
</P>
<P>(iii) Ten copies of such requests should be filed with the Office of Secretary and Administration as soon as possible after the issuance of the notice of meeting to which the request pertains. However, a single copy of the request will be accepted. Requests to close meetings must be received by the Office of Secretary and Administration no later than the time scheduled for the meeting to which such a request pertains.
</P>
<P>(3) The Secretary shall retain one copy of timely requests and forward one copy to each Commissioner, one copy to the interested Office, and two copies to the Docket Section, one for entry in the appropriate docket file, if any, and one to be posted on the Public Notice Board located in that section as an attachment to the Notice of Meeting to which it pertains.
</P>
<P>(4) Pleadings replying to requests to open or close shall not be accepted.
</P>
<P>(5) Any Commissioner may require that the Commission vote upon the request to open or close. If the request is supported by the votes of a majority of the agency membership, notice of change in meeting shall be issued and the Secretary shall immediately notify the requester and, before the close of business the next working day, have posted such vote and other material required by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section on the Commission's Public Notice Board.
</P>
<P>(6) If no Commissioner requests that a vote be taken on a request to open or close a Commission meeting, the Secretary shall by the close of the next working day after the meeting to which such request pertains certify that no vote was taken. The Secretary shall forward one copy of that certification to the requester and two copies of that certification to the Docket Section, one to be placed in the appropriate docket file, if any, and one to be posted on the Public Notice Board, where it will be displayed for one week.

A docket is formally established and proceedings initiated only by the issuance of a Commission notice or order except for certain negotiated service agreements for which the authority to establish a docket and initiate a proceeding by issuance of a Secretary's notice has been delegated to the Secretary.
</P>
<P>(f) The substance of the matter presented to the Commission, not the assigned docket type, shall govern the procedural requirements for the docket.

</P>
<P>(h) Public material filed within a docket may be viewed at the Commission's Docket Section during regular business hours.

Confidential material filed under seal in a docket may only be accessed with prior authorization. Part 3011 of this chapter sets forth the procedures for obtaining such authorization. Persons who wish to access confidential material should contact the Commission's Docket Section for the appropriate mode for transmitting material filed under seal.
</P>

<HEAD>§ 3010.107   Appeals from interlocutory rulings by presiding officers.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>General policy.</I> The Commission will not review interlocutory rulings of a presiding officer except in extraordinary circumstances.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Appeals certified by the presiding officer.</I> (1) Rulings of the presiding officer may be appealed to the Commission when the presiding officer certifies in writing that an interlocutory appeal is warranted. The presiding officer shall not certify an appeal unless the officer finds that:
</P>
<P>(i) The ruling involves an important question of law or policy concerning which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and
</P>
<P>(ii) An immediate appeal from the ruling will materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding or subsequent review will be an inadequate remedy.
</P>
<P>(2) A request for the presiding officer to certify an appeal shall be made by motion within five days after the presiding officer's ruling has been issued. The request shall set forth with specificity the reasons that a participant believes that an appeal meets the criteria of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section. Such requests shall also state in detail the legal, policy, and factual arguments supporting the participant's position that the ruling should be modified. If the appeal is from a ruling rejecting or excluding evidence, such request shall include a statement of the substance of the evidence which the participant contends would be adduced by the excluded evidence and the conclusions intended to be derived therefrom.
</P>
<P>(3) The presiding officer may request responsive pleadings from other participants prior to ruling upon the request to certify an appeal to the Commission.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Appeals not certified by the presiding officer.</I> A participant may request Commission review of a presiding officer's decision denying certification of an appeal by motion within five days of the decision. If the presiding officer fails to act on a request for certification within 15 days of the issuance of the ruling in question, the participant seeking certification may apply for review by the Commission within 20 days of the ruling in question. Unless the Commission directs otherwise, its review of the application for review will be based on the record and pleadings filed before the presiding officer pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Action by the Commission.</I> (1) The Commission may dismiss an appeal certified by the presiding officer if it determines that:
</P>
<P>(i) The objection to the ruling should be deferred until the Commission's consideration of the entire proceeding; or
</P>
<P>(ii) Interlocutory review is otherwise not warranted or appropriate under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>(2) When the presiding officer declines to certify an appeal, the Commission will not permit an interlocutory appeal unless it determines:
</P>
<P>(i) That the presiding officer should have certified the matter;
</P>
<P>(ii) That extraordinary circumstances exist; and
</P>
<P>(iii) That prompt Commission decision is necessary to prevent grave detriment to the public interest.
</P>
<P>(3) If the Commission fails to issue an order permitting an interlocutory appeal within 15 days after the presiding officer certifies the appeal or a participant files an application for review, the appeal shall be deemed denied. If the Commission issues an order permitting an appeal, it may rule upon the merits of the appeal in that order or at a later time.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Effect of appeals.</I> Unless the presiding officer or the Commission so orders, the certification of an appeal or the filing of an application for review shall not stay the proceeding or the effectiveness of any ruling.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Review at conclusion of proceeding.</I> If the Commission does not entertain an interlocutory appeal of a presiding officer's ruling, objection to the ruling may be raised:
</P>
<P>(1) In briefs to the presiding officer or the Commission at the conclusion of hearings on the record; or
</P>
<P>(2) By the deadline for submission of comments or reply comments, whichever is later, in all other proceedings in which a hearing on the record is not held.

<HEAD>§ 3010.125   Library references.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>In general.</I> A library reference is a special type of filing, which is accepted by the Commission for the convenience of the person filing material that is not conducive to typical text based filings. The filing of a document as a library reference is appropriate when interest in the material is limited, when the material constitutes a secondary source that provides background or support for a position or matter, or when references to, or identification of, the material filed as a library reference would be facilitated. Examples of materials that are appropriate for filing as library references include electronic spreadsheets, workpapers in support of primary documents, pre-existing materials, secondary sources such as books or materials that are not readily available elsewhere, or other foundational materials filed in support of a primary document. Whenever possible, library references are to be filed in electronic format. The Commission reserves the right to refuse acceptance of any library reference material in its docket room and its right to take other action to ensure all persons' ability to obtain access to the material.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Categorization of library references.</I> To the extent possible, material filed as a library reference shall be identified and referred to by participants in terms of the following categories:
</P>
<P>(1) Category 1—Reporting Systems Material (consisting of library references relating to the Postal Service's statistical cost and revenue reporting systems, and their primary outputs);
</P>
<P>(2) Category 2—Witness Foundational Material (consisting of material relating to the testimony of specific witnesses, primarily that which is essential to the establishment of a proper foundation for receiving into evidence the results of studies and analyses);
</P>
<P>(3) Category 3—Reference Material (consisting of previously published material provided for the convenience of the reader, such as books, chapters or other portions of books, articles, reports, manuals, handbooks, guides, and contracts);
</P>
<P>(4) Category 4—Material Provided in Response to Discovery (consisting of material provided in response to discovery requests);
</P>
<P>(5) Category 5—Disassociated Material (consisting of material filed at the request of another, from which the filing party wishes to be disassociated, is not vouching for or sponsoring the material provided);
</P>
<P>(6) Category 6—All Other Material (consisting of library references not fitting any of the other categories).
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Labeling.</I> Material filed as a library reference shall be labeled in a manner consistent with standard Commission notation and any other conditions the Commission or presiding officer establishes. Each library reference shall be identified by a unique identification number. The standard format for an identification number shall be “[abbreviated name of person filing]-LR-[docket identification]-[optional: NP][sequential number by person filing].” For example, “PRC-LR-CP2010-1-NP8” read right to left would be the eighth (8) non-public (NP) item filed in Docket No. (CP2010-1) as a library reference (LR) by the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC). Alternative formats may be used when required for clear identification of the material being filed.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Filing procedure.</I> Participants filing material as a library reference shall file contemporaneous written notice of this action. The notice shall:
</P>
<P>(1) Set forth the reason(s) why the material is being designated as a library reference;
</P>
<P>(2) Identify the category into which the material falls and describe in detail what the material consists of or represents, noting matters such as the presence of survey results;
</P>
<P>(3) Explain in detail how the material relates to the participant's case or to issues in the proceeding;
</P>
<P>(4) Identify authors or others materially contributing to substantive aspects of the preparation or development of the library reference;
</P>
<P>(5) Identify the documents (such as testimony, exhibits, and an interrogatory) or request to which the library reference relates, to the extent practicable;
</P>
<P>(6) Identify other library references or testimony relied upon or referred to in the designated material, to the extent practicable;
</P>
<P>(7) Indicate whether the library reference is an update or revision to another library reference and, if it is, clearly identify the predecessor material; and
</P>
<P>(8) To the extent feasible, for proceedings scheduled for a hearing on the record, identify portions expected to be entered into the record and the expected sponsor (if the participant filing a library reference anticipates seeking, on its own behalf, to enter all or part of the material contained therein into the evidentiary record). To the extent feasible, in all other proceeding types, identify portions relevant to the proceeding.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Optional preface or summary.</I> Inclusion of a preface or summary in a library reference addressing the matters set out in paragraphs (d)(1) through (8) of this section is encouraged, but optional.

<HEAD>§ 3010.142   Parties to hearings on the record.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Parties to a proceeding.</I> Any interested person may become a party to proceedings docketed for a hearing on the record by filing a notice of intervention. The Postal Service, and the Public Representative are automatically deemed parties in such proceedings without the need to file a notice of intervention. Persons who file a complaint are also automatically deemed a party to a complaint proceeding without the need to file a notice of intervention. Parties may be provided an opportunity to participate in discovery, file testimony, participate in the written or oral examination of witnesses, file briefs, or present oral argument before the Commission or the presiding officer. Persons that have not intervened may participate in a proceeding docketed for a hearing on the record, but such participation shall be limited to providing comments pursuant to § 3010.140 unless otherwise directed.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Notices of intervention.</I> A notice of intervention shall clearly and concisely set forth the nature and extent of the intervenor's interest in the issues to be decided, including the postal services utilized by the intervenor giving rise to the intervenor's interest in the proceeding, and to the extent known, the position of the intervenor with regard to the proposed changes in postal rates, fees, classifications, or services, or the subject matter of the complaint, as described in the notice of the proceeding. Such notice shall state whether or not the intervenor requests a hearing or in lieu thereof, a conference, and whether or not the intervenor intends to actively participate in a hearing. Such notice shall also include on page one thereof the name and full mailing address of no more than two persons who are to receive service, when necessary, of any documents relating to such proceeding.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Form and time of filing.</I> Notices of intervention shall be filed no later than the date fixed for such filing by the Commission or its Secretary, unless for good cause shown, the Commission authorizes a late filing. Without a showing for good cause, late intervenors shall be subject to and may not challenge decisions by the Commission or presiding officer made prior to acceptance of the request for late intervention.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Oppositions.</I> (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, oppositions to notices of intervention may be filed by any party in the proceeding no later than ten days after the notice of intervention is filed.
</P>
<P>(2) Oppositions to notices of interventions in proceedings considering the change in the nature of a postal service pursuant to part 3020 of this chapter may be filed by any party in the proceeding no later than three days after the notice of intervention is filed.
</P>
<P>(3) Pending Commission action, an opposition to intervention shall, in all proceedings except those considering the change in the nature of a postal service pursuant to part 3020 of this chapter, delay on a day-for-day basis the date for responses to discovery requests filed by that intervenor.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Effect of intervention.</I> A person filing a notice of intervention shall be a party to the proceeding subject, however, to a determination by the Commission, either in response to an opposition, or <I>sua sponte,</I> that party status is not appropriate under the Act. Intervenors are also subject to the right of the Commission or the presiding officer as specified in § 3010.104 to require two or more intervenors having substantially like interests and positions to join together for purposes of service of documents, presenting evidence, making and arguing motions and objections, propounding discovery, cross-examining witnesses, filing briefs, and presenting oral arguments to the Commission or presiding officer. No intervention shall be deemed to constitute a decision by the Commission that the intervenor is aggrieved for purposes of perfecting an appeal of any final order of the Commission.

<HEAD>§ 3010.302   Prehearing conferences.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Initiation and purposes.</I> The Commission or the presiding officer, if one has been appointed, may direct the parties in a proceeding to appear for a prehearing conference for the purposes of considering all possible ways of expediting the proceeding, including those in paragraph (e) of this section. Prehearing conference procedures shall be rigorously pursued by all parties.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Who presides.</I> The presiding officer, if one has been designated, shall preside over prehearing conferences. If a presiding officer has not been designated or is otherwise unavailable for a prehearing conference, then the ranking Commissioner in attendance shall be considered the presiding officer for that conference. The presiding officer shall open and close each prehearing conference session and shall be responsible for controlling the conduct of the conference.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Informal off-the-record procedures.</I> In order to make the prehearing conference as effective as possible, the presiding officer may direct that conferences be held off the record, without the presiding officer present. Informal off-the-record conferences shall be presided over by the Public Representative or such other person as the parties may select. At off-the-record conferences, parties shall be expected to reach agreement on those matters, which will expedite the proceeding, including the matters specified in the notice of the prehearing conference, in the ruling of the presiding officer directing that the off-the-record conference be held, and in paragraph (e) of this section. A report on the results of off-the-record conferences shall be made to the presiding officer on the record at a time specified by the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall then determine the further prehearing procedures, if any, to be followed.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Required preparation and cooperation of all parties.</I> All parties in any proceeding before the Commission are required and expected to come to prehearing conferences fully prepared to discuss in detail and resolve all matters, such as those specified in paragraph (e) of this section, in the notice of the prehearing conference, and in such other notice or agenda as may have been issued by the Commission or the presiding officer. All parties are required and expected to cooperate fully at all stages of the proceeding to achieve these objectives through thorough advance preparation for the prehearing conference, including informal communications between the parties, requests for discovery and appropriate discovery procedures at the earliest possible time and no later than at the prehearing conference, and the commencement of preparation of evidence and cross-examination. The failure of any party to appear at the prehearing conference or to raise any matters that could reasonably be anticipated and resolved at the prehearing conference shall not be permitted to unduly delay the progress of the proceeding and shall constitute a waiver of the rights of the party with regard thereto, including all objections to the agreements reached, actions taken, or rulings issued by the presiding officer with regard thereto.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Matters to be pursued.</I> At the prehearing conference, the presiding officer and the parties shall consider and resolve such matters as:
</P>
<P>(1) The definition and simplification of the issues, including any appropriate explanation, clarification, or amendment of any proposal, filing, evidence, complaint or other pleading filed by any party;
</P>
<P>(2) Arrangements for timely completion of discovery from the Postal Service or any other party of information regarding any issues in the proceeding, prior filings, evidence or pleadings of any party;
</P>
<P>(3) Procedures for timely discovery with regard to any future evidentiary filings of any party;
</P>
<P>(4) Stipulations, admissions or concessions as to evidentiary facts, and agreements as to documentary matters, exhibits and matters of official notice, which will avoid unnecessary proof or dispute;
</P>
<P>(5) The possible grouping of parties with substantially like interests for purposes of presenting evidence, making and arguing motions and objections, cross-examining witnesses, filing briefs, and presenting oral argument to the Commission or presiding officer;
</P>
<P>(6) Disclosure of the number, identity and qualifications of witnesses, and the nature of their testimony, particularly with respect to the policies of the Act and, as applicable according to the nature of the proceeding;
</P>
<P>(7) Limitation of the scope of the evidence and the number of witnesses in order to eliminate irrelevant, immaterial, or cumulative and repetitious evidence;
</P>
<P>(8) Procedures to direct and control the use of discovery prior to the hearing and submission of written testimony and exhibits on matters in dispute so as to restrict to a bare minimum the amount of hearing time required for oral cross-examination of witnesses;
</P>
<P>(9) Division of the proceeding where practicable into two or more phases for separate and, if advisable, simultaneous hearings;
</P>
<P>(10) Establishment of dates for the submission and service of such written testimony and exhibits as may be appropriate in advance of the hearing;
</P>
<P>(11) The order of presentation of the evidence and cross-examination of witnesses so that the hearing may proceed in the most expeditious and orderly manner possible; and
</P>
<P>(12) All other matters which would aid in an expeditious disposition of the proceeding, including consent of the parties to the conduct of the entire proceedings off the record.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Rulings by presiding officer.</I> (1) The presiding officer at a prehearing conference, shall, irrespective of the consent of the parties, dispose of by ruling:
</P>
<P>(i) Any of the procedural matters itemized in paragraph (e) of this section; and
</P>
<P>(ii) Such other procedural matters on which the presiding officer is authorized to rule during the course of the hearing if ruling at this stage would expedite the proceeding.
</P>
<P>(2) Either on the record at the conclusion of such prehearing conference, or by order issued shortly thereafter, the presiding officer shall state the agreements reached by the parties, the actions taken, and the rulings made by the presiding officer. Such rulings shall control the subsequent course of the proceedings unless modified during the hearing to prevent manifest injustice.

<HEAD>§ 3010.303   Hearing format.</HEAD>
<P>(a) In any case noticed for a proceeding to be determined on the record, the Commission or the presiding officer, if one has been appointed, may determine whether to hold a public hearing, or to hold a hearing by written submission of material only. A public hearing may be held if a hearing is requested by any party to the proceeding or if the Commission determines that a hearing is in the public interest. Generally, public hearings provide an opportunity for oral cross-examination of witnesses whereas hearings held by written submission of material only do not.
</P>
<P>(b) Once established, requests to change the hearing format may be proposed by motion, or by the Commission's or presiding officer's own motion.
</P>
<P>(c) Only representatives of the Commission, parties that have intervened in a proceeding, or persons intending to intervene prior to the deadline for notices of intervention may participate in a public hearing. However, public hearings are generally open to the public for observation. Public hearings may be closed to the public for good cause, or when confidential material is being presented.

<P>(a) <I>When issued.</I> Upon consideration of the outcome of the prehearing conference, if held, and a determination of the need for a public hearing, the Commission, or the presiding officer if one has been appointed, shall issue a scheduling order. The scheduling order may be combined with any other order or ruling that the Commission or the presiding officer may issue. The scheduling order may be periodically modified as warranted.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Content of scheduling order.</I> The content of the scheduling order shall be tailored to the specifics of the matter before the Commission, including any requirement for a public hearing. The Commission or the presiding officer shall consider scheduling the following:

Once the initial scheduling order is issued, but no later than ten calendar days prior to a scheduled hearing, parties may file notice of preferences for dates and times of witness appearance at any public hearing.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Subsequent scheduling of public hearings.</I> At the adjournment of any public hearing (including prehearing conferences), the Commission, or the presiding officer if appointed, shall announce when the hearing will reconvene.

<DIV8 N="§ 3010.310" NODE="39:1.0.2.17.6.6.1.6" TYPE="SECTION">
<HEAD>§ 3010.310   Discovery—general policy.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Sections 3010.311 through 3010.313 allow discovery reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence during a proceeding noticed for hearing on the record. In general, discovery against a party will be scheduled to end prior to the receipt into evidence of that party's direct case. An exception to this procedure shall operate in all proceedings set for hearing when a party needs to obtain information (such as operating procedures or data) available only from the Postal Service. Such discovery requests are permissible only for the purpose of the development of rebuttal testimony and may be made up to 20 days prior to the filing date for final rebuttal testimony.
</P>
<P>(b) The discovery procedures set forth in §§ 3010.311 through 3010.313 are not exclusive. Parties are encouraged to engage in informal discovery whenever possible to clarify exhibits and testimony. The results of these efforts may be introduced into the record by stipulation, by supplementary testimony or exhibit, by presenting selected written interrogatories and answers for adoption by a witness at the hearing, or by other appropriate means. In the interest of reducing motion practice, parties also are expected to use informal means to clarify questions and to identify portions of discovery requests considered overbroad or burdensome.
</P>
<P>(c) If a party or an officer or agent of a party fails to obey an order of the Commission or the presiding officer to provide or permit discovery pursuant to §§ 3010.311 through 3010.313, the Commission or the presiding officer may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others, may direct that the matters regarding which the order was made or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the proceeding in accordance with the claim of the parties obtaining the order, or prohibit the disobedient party from introducing designated matters in evidence, or strike the evidence, complaint or pleadings or parts thereof.

<HEAD>§ 3010.311   Interrogatories for purpose of discovery.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Service and contents.</I> In the interest of expedition and limited to information which appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, any party may propound to any other party in a proceeding written, sequentially numbered interrogatories, by witness, requesting non-privileged information relevant to the subject matter and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence in such proceeding, to be answered by the party served, who shall furnish such information as is available to the requesting party. A party through interrogatories may require any other party to identify each person whom the other party expects to call as a witness at the hearing and to state the subject matter on which the witness is expected to testify. The party propounding the interrogatories shall file them with the Commission and serve them on the answering party. Follow-up interrogatories to clarify or elaborate on the answer to an earlier discovery request may be filed after the initial discovery period ends. They must be filed within seven days of receipt of the answer to the previous interrogatory unless extraordinary circumstances are shown.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Answers.</I> Answers to discovery requests shall be prepared so that they can be incorporated as written cross-examination. Each answer shall begin on a separate page, identify the individual responding and the relevant testimony number, if any, the party who asked the question, and the number and text of the question. Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in the manner prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section. The party responding to the interrogatories shall file the answers with the Commission and serve them on the requesting party within 14 days of the filing of the interrogatories or within such other period as may be fixed by the Commission or presiding officer, but before the conclusion of the hearing.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Objections.</I> In the interest of expedition, the grounds for every objection shall be clearly and fully stated. If an objection is made to part of an interrogatory, the part shall be specified. A party claiming privilege shall identify the specific evidentiary privilege asserted and state the reasons for its applicability. A party claiming undue burden shall state with particularity the effort that would be required to answer the interrogatory, providing estimates of cost and work hours required, to the extent possible. An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily objectionable because an answer would involve an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the Commission or presiding officer may order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until a prehearing conference or other later time. Objections shall be filed with the Commission and served on the requesting party within ten days of the filing of the interrogatories. Any ground not stated in a timely objection is waived unless excused by the Commission or presiding officer for good cause shown.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Motions to compel responses to discovery.</I> Motions to compel a more responsive answer, or an answer to an interrogatory to which an objection was interposed, should be filed within 14 days of the answer or objection to the discovery request. The text of the discovery request, and any answer provided, should be provided as an attachment to the motion to compel. Parties who have objected to interrogatories which are the subject of a motion to compel shall have seven days to answer. Answers will be considered supplements to the arguments presented in the initial objection.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Compelled answers.</I> The Commission, or the presiding officer, upon motion of any party to the proceeding, may compel a more responsive answer, or an answer to an interrogatory to which an objection has been raised if the objection is overruled, or may compel an additional answer if the initial answer is found to be inadequate. Such compelled answers shall be filed with the Commission and served on the compelling party within seven days of the date of the order compelling an answer or within such other period as may be fixed by the Commission or presiding officer, but before the conclusion of the hearing.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Supplemental answers.</I> The individual or party who has answered interrogatories is under the duty to seasonably amend a prior answer if the individual or party obtains information upon the basis of which the individual or party knows that the answer was incorrect when made or is no longer true. Parties shall serve supplemental answers to update or to correct responses whenever necessary, up until the date the answer could have been accepted into evidence as written cross-examination. Parties filing supplemental answers shall indicate whether the answer merely supplements the previous answer to make it current or whether it is a complete replacement for the previous answer.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Orders.</I> The Commission or the presiding officer may order that any party or person shall answer on such terms and conditions as are just and may for good cause make any protective order, including an order limiting or conditioning interrogatories, as justice requires to protect a party or person from undue annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or expense.

<P>(a) <I>Service and contents.</I> In the interest of expedition and limited to information which appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, any party may serve on any other party to the proceeding a request to produce and permit the party making the request, or someone acting on behalf of the requesting party or the requesting party's agent to inspect and copy any designated documents or things that constitute or contain matters, not privileged, that are relevant to the subject matter involved in the proceeding or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and that are in the custody or control of the party to whom the request is addressed. The request shall set forth the items to be inspected either by individual item or category, and describe each item and category with reasonable particularity, and shall specify a reasonable time, place and manner of making inspection. The party requesting the production of documents or things shall file its request with the Commission and serve the request on the responding party.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Answers.</I> The party responding to the request shall file an answer with the Commission and serve the answer on the requesting party within 14 days after the request is filed, or within such other period as may be fixed by the Commission or presiding officer. The answer shall state, with respect to each item or category, that inspection will be permitted as requested unless the request is objected to pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. The responding party may produce copies of documents or of electronically stored information in lieu of permitting inspection. Production must be completed no later than the time for inspection specified in the request unless good cause is shown.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Objections.</I> In the interest of expedition, the grounds for objection shall be clearly and fully stated. If an objection is made to part of an item or category, the part shall be specified. Any objection must state whether any responsive materials are being withheld on the basis of that objection. A party claiming privilege shall identify the specific evidentiary privilege asserted and state with particularity the reasons for its applicability. A party claiming undue burden shall state with particularity the effort that would be required to answer the request, providing estimates of cost and work hours required, to the extent possible. Objections shall be filed with the Commission and served on the requesting party within ten days of the request for production. The responding party may state an objection to a request to produce electronically stored information. If it objects to the form of the documents or things requested (or if no form was specified in the request), the responding party must state the form or forms it intends to use to produce the requested information.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Motions to compel requests for production of documents or things for purposes of discovery.</I> Motions to compel shall be filed within 14 days of the answer or objection to the discovery request. The text of the discovery request, and any answer provided, should be provided as an attachment to the motion to compel. Parties who have objected to requests for production of documents or things which are the subject of a motion to compel shall have seven days to answer. Answers will be considered supplements to the arguments presented in the initial objection.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Compelled answers.</I> Upon motion of any party to the proceeding to compel a response to discovery, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Commission or the presiding officer may compel production of documents or things to which an objection is overruled. Such compelled documents or things shall be made available to the party making the motion within seven days of the date of the order compelling production or within such other period as may be fixed by the Commission or presiding officer, but before the conclusion of the hearing.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Orders and rulings.</I> The Commission or the presiding officer may direct any party or person to respond to a request for inspection on such terms and conditions as are just and may for good cause impose any protective conditions, including limitations or preconditions for inspections, as justice requires to protect a party or person from undue annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or expense.

<HEAD>§ 3010.313   Requests for admissions for purpose of discovery.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Service and content.</I> In the interest of expedition, any party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission, for purposes of the pending proceeding only, of any relevant, unprivileged facts, including the genuineness of any documents or exhibits to be presented in the hearing. Each requested admission shall be set forth separately and shall be deemed admitted unless within 14 days after the request is filed (or such other period as may be fixed by the Commission or presiding officer) the party to whom the request is directed files a written answer denying the requested admission pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or objecting pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. The party requesting an admission shall file its request with the Commission and serve the request on the responding party.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Answers.</I> Answers that fail to admit a matter as requested shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission. When a party qualifies an answer or denies only a part of the admission requested, the party shall specify so much of the requested admission as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. A failure to admit or deny for lack of information or knowledge shall not be made unless the responding party states that it has made a reasonable inquiry and that information known or readily obtainable by the party is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny. A party who answers a request for admission shall file its answer with the Commission and serve the answer on the requesting party.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Objections.</I> If an objection is made, the grounds for such objection shall be clearly and fully stated.

The text of the request for admissions, and any answer provided, should be provided as an attachment to the motion to compel. Parties who have objected to requests for admissions which are the subject of a motion to compel shall have seven days to file a response. Responses will be considered supplements to the arguments presented in the initial objection.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Compelled answers.</I> The Commission or the presiding officer may compel answers to a request for admissions to which an objection has been raised if the objection is overruled. Such compelled answers shall be filed with the Commission and served on the requesting party within seven days of the date of the order compelling production or within such other period as may be fixed by the Commission or the presiding officer, but before the conclusion of the hearing. If the Commission or presiding officer determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this rule, it may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be filed.

If there is a prehearing conference, the prehearing conference is to be considered the first hearing session in that docket.
</P>
<P>(2) At the adjournment of each hearing session, the presiding officer responsible for the conduct of that hearing session shall announce if and when the hearing will reconvene. If an announcement is not made at the adjournment of the hearing session, the Commission or presiding officer shall announce the time, date, and location of any subsequent hearing, or prehearing conference, in writing by notice, order, or presiding officer ruling.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Who presides.</I> The presiding officer, if designated, shall preside over a public hearing.

</P>
<P>(e) <I>Order of presentations.</I> (1) The proponent of a matter before the Commission shall present the proponent's direct case first. In matters initiated by the Postal Service, the Postal Service shall be considered the proponent.

In all other instances, the Commission or the presiding officer shall determine the order of presentation.
</P>
<P>(2) The order of presentations by parties other than the proponent shall be determined by the Commission or the presiding officer.
</P>
<P>(3) The Commission or presiding officer shall announce the order of presentation of parties and individual witnesses prior to hearing sessions and shall issue such other procedural orders as may be necessary to assure the orderly and expeditious conclusion of the hearing.

Do you solemnly swear (or affirm), that the testimony that you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Please state your full name.”
</P>
<P>(2) The oath shall be given upon the first appearance of the witness providing testimony. Upon subsequent appearances, the witness is to be reminded by the presiding officer that the witness remains under oath for the duration of the proceeding.
</P>
<P>(3) Witnesses not attending a hearing whose testimony is entered by counsel during a hearing shall attach a signed declaration that the testimony being submitted is that of the witness. A declaration shall be included with each piece of written testimony, and each set of written cross-examination. The declaration shall state the following (or an equivalent): “Declaration of [witness name]. I, [witness name], hereby declare under penalty of perjury that: The [testimony, designated responses to written cross-examination] filed under my name were prepared by me or under my direction; and were I to [provide oral testimony, respond orally to the questions appearing in the interrogatories], my answers would be the same.”
</P>
<P>(4) Hearings that are conducted by the written submission of testimony only shall also attach written declarations to testimony and cross-examination as described above.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Presentation of the evidence</I>—(1) <I>Presentations by parties.</I> Each party shall have the right to present evidence, cross-examine witnesses (limited to testimony adverse to the party conducting the cross-examination), and to present objections, motions, and arguments. The case-in-chief of parties other than the proponent shall be in writing and shall include the party's direct case and rebuttal, if any, to the initial proponent's case-in-chief. A party's presentation may be accompanied by a trial brief or legal memoranda. Legal memoranda on matters at issue are generally welcome at any stage of the proceeding. Parties will be given an opportunity to rebut presentations of other parties, including an opportunity for the initial proponent to present surrebuttal evidence. New affirmative matter (not in reply to another party's direct case) should not be included in rebuttal testimony or exhibits. When objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence before the Commission or the presiding officer are made, the grounds relied upon shall be stated. Formal exceptions to rulings are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Written testimony.</I> (i) Written testimony shall be offered in evidence by motion. The motion shall be made orally during a hearing, or in writing when the hearing is conducted by the written submission of testimony only. When a party moves to enter testimony into the record, three hard copies of the document shall simultaneously be submitted to the Commission for the record. The copies are to be printed single-sided, and not stapled, hole-punched, or bound, but may be fastened together by paper or binder clip, or equivalent.
</P>
<P>(ii) Witnesses shall be provided an opportunity to verify that the written testimony they are sponsoring is their testimony and that it would be the same if given orally. The witness, or counsel, shall state the original filing date of the testimony and identify all subsequent filings that amended the original testimony. If there are any final corrections to the testimony, the corrections may be noted on the hard copies submitted to the Commission. However, the witness shall be required to file errata to the testimony within seven days of the hearing, making corrections only to the extent as identified during the hearing. Any other changes shall be requested separately by motion to amend the record.
</P>
<P>(iii) Parties shall be provided an opportunity to object to all or part of a witness's written testimony prior to entering that testimony into the record. Objections that have not previously been made in writing at least 14 days prior to the hearing date shall be granted only under extraordinary circumstances.
</P>
<P>(iv) After resolution of all objections, the presiding officer shall order the testimony entered into the record as evidence. Unless otherwise ordered by the presiding officer, the written testimony shall not be copied into the hearing transcript.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Library references.</I> (i) Library references sponsored by a witness and associated with the witness's written testimony or written cross-examination may be offered in evidence by motion. The motion shall be made orally during a public hearing, or in writing for a hearing that is conducted by the written submission of testimony only.
</P>
<P>(ii) Witnesses shall be provided an opportunity to verify that the library reference is their library reference and to affirm that they are in fact sponsoring the library reference. If a witness inadvertently fails to verify and affirm that the witness is sponsoring a library reference that is cited in written testimony or in response to written cross-examination, it will be presumed that the library reference is to be included in the record to the extent specified in the notice of the filing of the library reference.
</P>
<P>(iii) Parties shall be provided an opportunity to object to all or any part of the library reference being entered into the record. Objections that have not been made in writing at least 14 days prior to the hearing date shall be granted only under extraordinary circumstances.
</P>
<P>(iv) After resolution of all objections, the presiding officer shall order the library reference be entered into the record as evidence. Unless ordered by the presiding officer, library references shall not be copied into the hearing transcript.
</P>
<P>(4) <I>Written cross-examination.</I> (i) Written cross-examination will be utilized as a substitute for oral cross-examination whenever possible, particularly to introduce factual or statistical evidence. Written cross-examination may be offered in evidence by motion. The motion shall be made orally during a public hearing, or in writing for a hearing that is conducted by the written submission of testimony only. Written cross-examination proposed by parties other than the party associated with the witness shall be considered first, followed by that of the party of the witness.
</P>
<P>(ii) Designations of written cross-examination should be filed with the Commission and served on the answering party no later than three working days before the scheduled appearance of a witness. Designations shall identify every item to be offered as evidence, listing the party who initially posed the discovery request, the witness and/or party to whom the question was addressed (if different from the witness answering), the number of the request and, if more than one answer is provided, the dates of all answers to be included in the record. (For example, “PR-T1-17 to USPS witness Jones, answered by USPS witness Smith (March 1, 1997) as updated (March 21, 1997)).” When a party designates written cross-examination, three hard copies of the documents to be included shall simultaneously be submitted to the Secretary. The documents are to be printed single-sided, and not stapled, hole-punched, or bound, but may be fastened together by paper or binder clip, or equivalent. The Secretary shall prepare for the record a packet containing all materials designated for written cross-examination in a format that facilitates review by the witness and counsel.
</P>
<P>(iii) A witness shall be provided an opportunity to verify that the written cross-examination is that of the witness and to assert that if the written cross-examination were being provided orally at the hearing it would be that of the witness. If there are any final corrections to the written cross-examination, the corrections may be noted on the hard copies before submission to the Commission.
</P>
<P>(iv) Parties shall be provided an opportunity to object to all or any part of the written cross-examination prior to entering the testimony into the record.
</P>
<P>(v) After resolution of all objections, the presiding officer shall order the written cross-examination entered into the record as evidence. The presiding office shall direct that the written cross-examination be copied into the hearing transcript.
</P>
<P>(5) <I>Oral cross-examination.</I> (i) Oral cross-examination will be permitted for clarifying written cross-examination and for testing assumptions, conclusions, or other opinion evidence.
</P>
<P>(ii) Notices of intent to conduct oral cross-examination should be filed three or more working days before the announced appearance of the witness and should include specific references to the subject matter to be examined and page references to the relevant direct testimony and exhibits. If no notices are filed, and the Commission or presiding officer has no other reason for the witness to appear, the Commission or the presiding officer, in their discretion, may excuse the witness from appearing at the hearing and direct that the witness's testimony be entered by counsel.
</P>
<P>(iii) A party intending to use complex numerical hypotheticals, or to question using intricate or extensive cross-references, shall provide adequately documented cross-examination exhibits for the record. Copies of these exhibits should be filed at least two full business days before the scheduled appearance of the witness. They may be filed online or delivered in hardcopy form to counsel for the witness, at the discretion of the party. When presented, examination exhibits are not to be considered record evidence. They are to be transcribed into the record for reference only. If adopted by the witness, the examination exhibit may be offered in evidence by motion.
</P>
<P>(iv) At the conclusion of oral cross-examination, the witness shall be given an opportunity to consult with counsel. Counsel shall then be provided an opportunity to examine the witness for the purpose of clarifying statements previously made during oral cross-examination.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Institutional testimony.</I> (1) This paragraph (h) is applicable to testimony offered in evidence that is not sponsored by an individual witness. This typically occurs when discovery questions are answered by the institution, and not by an individual witness.
</P>
<P>(2) When institutional responses are offered in evidence by any party, the responding party shall make available at the hearing an officer of the institution that has the authority to attest to the authenticity and truthfulness of the responses, and that has the knowledge to be subject to oral cross-examination in regard to the responses. Section 3010.321 applies as if the officer of the institution were an individual witness.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Limitations on presentation of the evidence.</I> The taking of evidence shall proceed with all reasonable diligence and dispatch, and to that end, the Commission or the presiding officer may limit appropriately the number of witnesses to be heard upon any issue, the examination by any party to specific issues, and the cross-examination of a witness to that required for a full and true disclosure of the facts necessary for the disposition of the proceeding and to avoid irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious testimony.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Motions during hearing.</I> After a hearing has commenced, a request may be made by motion to the presiding officer for any procedural ruling or relief desired. Such motions shall specify the ruling or relief sought, and state the grounds therefor and statutory or other supporting authority. Motions made during hearings may be stated orally upon the record, except that the presiding officer may require that such motions be reduced to writing and filed separately. Any party shall have the opportunity to answer or object to such motions at the time and in the manner directed by the presiding officer.
</P>
<P>(k) <I>Rulings on motions.</I> The presiding officer is authorized to rule upon any such motion not formally acted upon by the Commission prior to the commencement of a prehearing conference or hearing where immediate ruling is essential in order to proceed with the prehearing conference or hearing, and upon any motion to the presiding officer filed or made after the commencement thereof, except that no motion made to the presiding officer, a ruling upon which would involve or constitute a final determination of the proceeding, shall be ruled upon affirmatively by the presiding officer except as a part of a presiding officer's intermediate decision. This section shall not preclude a presiding officer, within the presiding officer's discretion, from referring any motion made in hearing to the Commission for ultimate determination.
</P>
<P>(l) <I>Transcript corrections.</I> Corrections to the transcript of a hearing should not be requested except to correct a material substantive error in the transcription made at the hearing. Any request to correct a transcript shall be by motion filed no later than seven days after the transcript, or notice of the availability of a confidential transcript, is posted to the Commission's website. Corrections or changes to actual testimony shall not be allowed.

<HEAD>§ 3010.322   Evidence—general.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Form and admissibility.</I> In all hearings, relevant and material evidence which is not unduly repetitious or cumulative shall be admissible. Witnesses whose testimony is to be taken shall be sworn, or shall affirm, before their testimony shall be deemed evidence in the proceeding or any questions are put to them.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Documentary material</I>—(1) <I>General.</I> Documents and detailed data and information shall be presented as exhibits. Exhibits should be self-explanatory. They should contain appropriate footnotes or narrative explaining the source of each item of information used and the methods employed in statistical compilations. The principal title of each exhibit should state what it contains or represents. The title may also contain a statement of the purpose for which the exhibit is offered; however, this statement will not be considered part of the evidentiary record. Where one part of a multi-part exhibit is based on another part or on another exhibit, appropriate cross-references should be made. Relevant exposition should be included in the exhibits or provided in accompanying testimony. Testimony, exhibits and supporting workpapers prepared for Commission proceedings that are premised on data or conclusions developed in a library reference shall provide the location of that information within the library reference with sufficient specificity to permit ready reference, such as the page and line, or the file and the worksheet or spreadsheet page or cell. Where relevant and material matter offered in evidence is embraced in a document containing other matter not material or relevant or not intended to be put in evidence, the party offering the same shall plainly designate the matter offered excluding the immaterial or irrelevant parts. If other matter in such document is in such bulk or extent as would unnecessarily encumber the record, it may be marked for identification, and, if properly authenticated, the relevant and material parts may be read into the record, or, if the Commission or presiding officer so directs, a true copy of such matter in proper form shall be received in evidence as an exhibit. Copies of documents shall be delivered by the party offering the same to the other parties or their attorneys appearing at the hearing, who shall be afforded an opportunity to examine the entire document and to offer in evidence in like manner other material and relevant portions thereof.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Status of library references.</I> Designation of material as a library reference and acceptance in the Commission's docket section do not confer evidentiary status. The evidentiary status of the material is governed by § 3010.321(g)(3).
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Commission's files.</I> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) of this section, any matter contained in a report or other document on file with the Commission may be offered in evidence by specifying the report, document, or other file containing the matter so offered and the report or other document need not be produced or marked for identification.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Public document items.</I> Whenever there is offered in evidence (in whole or in part) a public document, such as an official report, decision, opinion or published scientific or economic statistical data issued by any of the Executive Departments (or their subdivisions), legislative agencies or committees, or administrative agencies of the Federal Government (including Government-owned corporations) and such document (or part thereof) has been shown by the offeror thereof to be reasonably available to the public, such document need not be produced or physically marked for identification, but may be offered in evidence as a public document item by clearly identifying the document and the relevant parts thereof.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Designation of evidence from other Commission dockets.</I> (1) Parties may request that evidence received in other Commission proceedings be entered into the record of the current proceeding. These requests shall be made by motion, shall explain the purpose of the designation, and shall identify material by page and line or paragraph number.
</P>
<P>(2) In proceedings to consider the appeal of a Postal Service determination to close or consolidate a post office conducted pursuant to part 3021 of this chapter, these requests must be made at least six days before the date for filing the party's direct case. Oppositions to motions for designations and/or requests for counter-designations shall be filed within three days. Oppositions to requests for counter-designations are due within two days.
</P>
<P>(3) In all other proceedings subject to this section, these requests must, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, be made at least 28 days before the date for filing the party's direct case. Oppositions to motions for designations and/or requests for counter-designations shall be filed within 14 days. Oppositions to requests for counter-designations are due within seven days.
</P>
<P>(4) In all proceedings subject to this section, the moving party must submit two copies of the identified material to the Secretary at the time requests for designations and counter-designations are made.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Form of prepared testimony and exhibits.</I> Unless the presiding officer otherwise directs, the direct testimony of witnesses shall be reduced to writing and offered either as such or as an exhibit. All prepared testimony and exhibits of a documentary character shall, so far as practicable, conform to the requirements of § 3010.124(a) and (b).
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Copies to parties.</I> Except as otherwise provided in these rules, copies of exhibits shall be furnished to the presiding officer and to the parties or counsel during a hearing, unless the presiding officer otherwise directs.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Reception and ruling.</I> The presiding officer shall rule on the admissibility of evidence and otherwise control the reception of evidence so as to confine it to the issues in the proceeding.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Offers of proof.</I> Any offer of proof made in connection with any ruling of the presiding officer rejecting or excluding proffered oral testimony shall consist of a statement of the substance of the evidence which counsel contends would be adduced by such testimony; and if the excluded evidence consists of evidence in documentary or written form, or of reference to documents or records, a copy of such evidence shall be marked for identification and shall constitute the offer of proof.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Official notice of facts.</I> Official notice may be taken of such matters as might be judicially noticed by the courts of the United States or of any other matter peculiarly within the knowledge of the Commission as an expert body. Any party shall, on timely request, be afforded an opportunity to show the contrary.

Separate statements concerning the model limitations, including limiting model design assumptions and range of data input utilized in model design, shall be provided. Where test and validation of the entire simulation model are not possible, test and validation information shall be provided for disaggregate portions of the model. If disaggregate testing and validation are not possible, separate statements to that effect and statements regarding operational experts' review of model validity shall be provided.
</P>
<P>(2) Upon timely and otherwise proper request of a party, or <I>sua sponte,</I> the Commission or the presiding officer may rule that matters other than those listed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (viii) of this section are necessary to establish the foundation for reception of the evidence concerned and must be furnished.
</P>
<P>(3) When the requestor is other than the Commission or the presiding officer, the cost of producing the material required in paragraphs (b)(1)(iv), (vi), and (vii) of this section, shall be borne by the requesting party unless otherwise ordered, for good cause shown by the requestor. When the Commission or the presiding officer is the requestor, it may assume or equitably allocate such costs for good cause shown by the requester.
</P>
<P>(4) If the recipient of a request for materials pursuant to this paragraph (b) asserts that compliance with the request would conflict with patent, copyright, trade secret or contract rights applicable to the requested material, the recipient shall immediately notify the requestor and the presiding officer. If valid, the presiding officer shall devise means of accommodating such rights. Such means may include protective orders, including access under protective conditions to the computer facilities of the recipient of a request, making material available for inspection, compensation, or other procedures, according to the nature of the right affected by compliance with this paragraph (b). If the presiding officer determines that compensation is necessary to accommodate the affected right, the cost of compensation shall be borne in the same manner that paragraph (b)(3) of this section prescribes for bearing the costs referenced there. If such right cannot be accommodated by reasonable compensation, or by protective orders or other procedures, and, as a result, materials required by this paragraph (b) cannot be provided, the presiding officer shall determine, in the presiding officer's discretion, whether evidence that relies upon the materials not provided shall be admissible or afforded limited weight.

In addition, there shall be a clear statement of the facts and judgments upon which conclusions are based, together with an indication of the alternative courses of action considered and the steps taken to ensure the validity, accuracy, and reliability of the evidence. Tabulations of input data, workbooks, and all other materials necessary to replicate results shall be made available upon request at the offices of the Commission.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Expedition.</I> The party who offers studies or analyses in evidence shall expedite responses to requests made pursuant to this section for data or other information. Responses shall be served on the requesting party, and notice thereof filed with the Secretary in accordance with the provisions of § 3010.127 no later than 3 days after a request is made under § 3010.322(e)(2) or no later than 14 days after a request is made under § 3010.322(e)(3).

In cases subject to a limitation on the time available to the Commission for decision, the Commission may direct each party to file its brief simultaneously with the filing of briefs by other parties. In cases where, because of the nature of the issues and the record or the limited number of parties involved, the filing of initial and reply briefs, or the filing of initial, answering, and reply briefs, will not unduly delay the conclusion of the proceeding and will aid in the proper disposition of the proceeding, the parties may be directed to file more than one brief and at different times rather than a single brief filed simultaneously with briefs filed by other parties. The Commission or presiding officer may also order the filing of briefs during the course of the proceeding.

The respondent shall answer each interrogatory and furnish such information as is available. The participant propounding the interrogatories shall file them with the Commission in conformance with part 3010, subpart B, of this chapter. Follow-up interrogatories that clarify or elaborate on the answer to an earlier discovery request may be filed after the period for intervenor discovery on the Postal Service case ends, if the interrogatories are filed within seven days of receipt of the answer to the previous interrogatory. In extraordinary circumstances, follow-up interrogatories may be filed not less than six days prior to the filing date for the participant's rebuttal or surrebuttal testimony.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Answers.</I> (1) Answers to interrogatories shall be prepared so that they can be incorporated into the record as written cross-examination. Each answer shall begin on a separate page, identify the individual responding and the relevant testimony number, if any, the participant who propounded the interrogatory, and the number and text of the question.
</P>
<P>(2) Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing by the individual responsible for the answer, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in a motion to be excused from answering in the manner prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section.
</P>
<P>(3) An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily objectionable because an answer would involve an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact.
</P>
<P>(4) Answers filed by a respondent shall be filed in conformance with subpart B to part 3010 of this chapter within seven days of the filing of the interrogatories or within such other period as may be fixed by the Commission or presiding officer. Any other period fixed by the Commission or presiding officer shall end before the conclusion of the hearing.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Motion to be excused from answering.</I> A respondent may, in lieu of answering an interrogatory, file a motion pursuant to § 3020.105(b) to be excused from answering.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Supplemental answers.</I> A respondent has a duty to timely amend a prior answer if it obtains information upon the basis of which it knows that the answer was incorrect when made or is no longer true. A respondent shall serve supplemental answers to update or to correct responses whenever necessary, up until the date the answer could have been accepted into evidence as written cross-examination. A respondent shall indicate whether the answer merely supplements the previous answer to make it current or whether it is a complete replacement for the previous answer.

<HEAD>§ 3020.118   Production of documents.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Service and contents.</I> (1) In the interest of expedition and limited to information which appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, any participant may serve on any other participant a request to produce and permit the participant making the request, or someone acting on behalf of the participant, to inspect and copy any designated documents or things that constitute or contain matters, not privileged, that are relevant to the subject matter involved in the proceeding and that are in the custody or control of the respondent.
</P>
<P>(2) The request shall set forth the items to be inspected either by individual item or category, and describe each item and category with reasonable particularity, and shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making inspection. The participant requesting the production of documents or items shall file its request with the Commission in conformance with part 3010, subpart B, of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Answers.</I> (1) The respondent shall file an answer to a request under paragraph (a) of this section with the Commission in conformance with subpart B to part 3010 of this chapter within seven days after the request is filed, or within such other period as may be fixed by the Commission or presiding officer. The answer shall state, with respect to each item or category, whether inspection will be permitted as requested.
</P>
<P>(2) If the respondent objects to an item or category, it shall state the reasons for objection in a motion to be excused from answering as prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section.
</P>

<HEAD>§ 3020.119   Admissions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Service and content.</I> In the interest of expedition, any participant may serve upon any other participant a written request for the admission of any relevant, unprivileged facts, including the genuineness of any documents or exhibits to be presented in the hearing. The admission shall be for purposes of the pending proceeding only. The participant requesting the admission shall file its request with the Commission in conformance with subpart B to part 3010 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Answers.</I> (1) A matter for which admission is requested shall be separately set forth in the request and is deemed admitted unless, within seven days after the request is filed, or within such other period as may be established by the Commission or presiding officer, the respondent files a written answer or motion to be excused from answering pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. Answers to requests for admission shall be filed with the Commission in conformance with subpart B to part 3010 of this chapter.
</P>
<P>(2) If the answer filed by the respondent does not admit a matter asserted in the participant's request, it must either specifically deny the matter or explain in detail why it cannot truthfully admit or deny the asserted matter. When good faith requires, the respondent must admit a portion of the asserted matter and either deny or qualify the remaining portion of such asserted matter. Lack of knowledge for failing to admit or deny can be invoked only after reasonable inquiry if the information already possessed or reasonably obtainable is insufficient to enable an admission or denial.
</P>
<P>(3) Grounds for objection to requests for admission must be stated. Objections cannot be based solely upon the ground that the request presents a genuine issue for trial.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Motion to be excused from answering.</I> A respondent may, in lieu of answering a request for admission, file a motion pursuant to § 3020.105(b) to be excused from answering.

Testimony that exceeds the scope of the Postal Service's proposal or rebuttal testimony shall not be permitted.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Motion for leave to file surrebuttal.</I> A participant who wishes to file surrebuttal testimony must obtain prior approval by filing with the Commission a motion for leave to file surrebuttal pursuant to § 3020.105(d) on or before the date provided in the procedural schedule established by the Commission.

<HEAD>§ 3020.122   Hearings.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Initiation.</I> Hearings for the purpose of taking evidence shall be initiated by the issuance of a notice and scheduling order pursuant to § 3020.110.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Presiding officer.</I> All hearings shall be held before the Commission sitting <I>en banc</I> with a duly designated presiding officer.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Entering of appearances.</I> The Commission or the presiding officer before whom the hearing is held will cause to be entered on the record all appearances together with a notation showing on whose behalf each such appearance has been made.
</P>
<P>(d) <I>Order of procedure.</I> In requests for advisory opinions before the Commission, the Postal Service shall be the first participant to present its case. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the presiding officer shall direct the order of presentation of all other participants and issue such other procedural orders as may be necessary to assure the orderly and expeditious conclusion of the hearing.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Presentation of the evidence</I>—(1) <I>Presentations by participants.</I> Each participant shall have the right in public hearings to present evidence relevant to the Postal Service's proposal, cross-examine (limited to testimony adverse to the participant conducting the cross-examination), object, move, and argue. The participant's presentation shall be in writing and may be accompanied by a trial brief or legal memoranda. (Legal memoranda on matters at issue will be welcome at any stage of the proceeding.) When objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence before the Commission or the presiding officer are made, the grounds relied upon shall be stated. Formal exceptions to rulings are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>(2) <I>Written cross-examination.</I> Written cross-examination will be utilized as a substitute for oral cross-examination whenever possible, particularly to introduce factual or statistical evidence. Designations of written cross-examination shall be served in accordance with part 3010, subpart B, of this chapter no later than three days before the scheduled appearance of a witness. Designations shall identify every item to be offered as evidence, listing the participant who initially posed the discovery request, the witness and/or party to whom the question was addressed (if different from the witness answering), the number of the request and, if more than one answer is provided, the dates of all answers to be included in the record. (For example, “PR-T1-17 to USPS witness Jones, answered by USPS witness Smith (March 1, 1997) as updated (March 21, 1997)”). When a participant designates written cross-examination, two hard copies of the documents (unfastened, single-spaced, not hole-punched) are to be included and shall simultaneously be submitted to the Secretary of the Commission. The Secretary of the Commission shall prepare for the record a packet containing all materials designated for written cross-examination in a format that facilitates review by the witness and counsel. The witness will verify the answers and materials in the packet, and they will be entered into the transcript by the presiding officer. Counsel may object to written cross-examination at that time, and any designated answers or materials ruled objectionable will not be admitted into the record.
</P>
<P>(3) <I>Oral cross-examination.</I> Oral cross-examination will be permitted for clarifying written cross-examination and for testing assumptions, conclusions or other opinion evidence. Notices of intent to conduct oral cross-examination shall be filed three or more days before the announced appearance of the witness and shall include specific references to the subject matter to be examined and page references to the relevant direct testimony and exhibits. A participant intending to use complex numerical hypotheticals, or to question using intricate or extensive cross-references, shall provide adequately documented cross-examination exhibits for the record. Copies of these exhibits shall be filed at least two days (including one working day) before the scheduled appearance of the witness. They may be filed online or delivered in hardcopy form to counsel for the witness, at the discretion of the participant. If a participant has obtained permission to receive service of documents in hardcopy form, hardcopy notices of intent to conduct oral cross-examination of witnesses for that participant shall be delivered to counsel for that participant and served three or more working days before the announced appearance of the witness. Cross-examination exhibits shall be delivered to counsel for the witness at least two days (including one working day) before the scheduled appearance of the witness.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Limitations on presentation of the evidence.</I> The taking of evidence shall proceed with all reasonable diligence and dispatch, and to that end, the Commission or the presiding officer may limit appropriately:
</P>
<P>(1) The number of witnesses to be heard upon any issue;
</P>
<P>(2) The examination by any participant to specific issues; and
</P>
<P>(3) The cross-examination of a witness to that required for a full and true disclosure of the facts necessary for exploration of the Postal Service's proposal, disposition of the proceeding, and the avoidance of irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious testimony.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Motions during hearing.</I> Except as provided in § 3020.105(a), after a hearing has commenced in a proceeding, a request may be made by motion to the presiding officer for any procedural ruling or relief desired. Such motions shall set forth the ruling or relief sought, and state the grounds therefore and statutory or other supporting authority. Motions made during hearings may be stated orally upon the record, except that the presiding officer may require that such motions be reduced to writing and filed separately. Any participant shall have the opportunity to answer or object to such motions at the time and in the manner directed by the presiding officer.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Rulings on motions.</I> The presiding officer is authorized to rule upon any motion not reserved for decision by the Commission in § 3020.105(a). This section shall not preclude a presiding officer from referring any motion made in hearing to the Commission for ultimate determination.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Transcript corrections.</I> Corrections to the transcript of a hearing shall not be requested except to correct a material substantive error in the transcription made at the hearing.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Field hearings.</I> Field hearings will not be held except upon a showing by any participant and determination by the Commission that there is exceptional need or utility for such a hearing which cannot be accomplished by alternative means.

<HEAD>§ 3030.100   Applicability.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The rules in this part implement provisions in 39 U.S.C. chapter 36, subchapter I, establishing the modern system of ratemaking for regulating rates and classes for market dominant products. The rules in this part are applicable whenever the Postal Service proposes to adjust a rate of general applicability for any market dominant product, which includes the addition of a new rate, the removal of an existing rate, or a change to an existing rate. Current rates may be found in the Mail Classification Schedule appearing on the Commission's website at <I>www.prc.gov.</I>
</P>
<P>(b) Rates may be adjusted either subject to the rules appearing in subpart B of this part, which includes a limitation on rate increases, or subject to the rules appearing in subpart I of this part, which does not include a limitation on rate increases but requires either extraordinary or exceptional circumstances. The rules applicable to the calculation of the limitations on rate increases appear in subparts C through H of this part. The rules for workshare discounts, which are applicable whenever market dominant rates are adjusted, appear in subpart J of this part.

<HEAD>§ 3030.101   Definitions.</HEAD>
<P>(a) The definitions in paragraphs (b) through (l) of this section apply to this part.
</P>
<P>(b) <I>Annual limitation</I> means the annual limitation on the percentage change in rates equal to the change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U) unadjusted for seasonal variation over the most recently available 12-month period preceding the date the Postal Service files a request to review its notice of rate adjustment, as determined by the Commission.
</P>
<P>(c) <I>Banked rate authority</I> means unused rate adjustment authority accumulated for future use pursuant to the rules in this part.
</P>
<P>(d) A <I>class</I> of mail means the First-Class Mail, USPS Marketing Mail, Periodicals, Package Services, or Special Services groupings of market dominant Postal Service products or services. Generally, the regulations in this part are applicable to individual classes of mail.
</P>
<P>(e) <I>Density rate authority</I> means rate authority that is available to all classes to address the effects of decreases in density of mail.
</P>
<P>(f) <I>Maximum rate adjustment authority</I> means the maximum percentage change in rates available to a class for any planned increase in rates. It is the sum of: The consumer price index rate authority, and any available density rate authority, retirement obligation rate authority, banked rate authority, and rate authority applicable to non-compensatory classes.
</P>
<P>(g) <I>Rate authority applicable to non-compensatory classes</I> means rate authority available to classes where revenue for each product within the class was insufficient to cover that product's attributable costs as determined by the Commission.
</P>
<P>(h) <I>Rate cell</I> means each and every separate rate identified as a rate of general applicability.
</P>
<P>(i) <I>Rate incentive</I> means a discount that is not a workshare discount and that is designed to increase or retain volume, improve the value of mail for mailers, or improve the operations of the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>(j) <I>Rate incentive comparison period</I> is a period of time in the fiscal year or calendar year immediately before a rate incentive that is not a rate of general applicability is offered. A rate incentive comparison period must be not less than 3 months in length and not more than 12 months in length. Except for a rate incentive that is not a rate of general applicability that has a term of 1 calendar year, the rate incentive comparison period is the same period of months and days in the fiscal year or calendar year immediately before the rate incentive is offered as the term of the rate incentive. For any rate incentive that is not a rate of general applicability that has a term of 1 calendar year, the rate incentive comparison period shall be either: the calendar year that is most recently ended before the rate incentive is offered; or the fiscal year that is most recently ended before the rate incentive is offered.
</P>
<P>(k) <I>Rate of general applicability</I> means a rate applicable to all mail meeting standards established by the Mail Classification Schedule, the Domestic Mail Manual, and the International Mail Manual. A rate is not a rate of general applicability if eligibility for the rate is dependent on factors other than the characteristics of the mail to which the rate applies. A rate incentive is not a rate of general applicability if eligibility for the rate is wholly or partially dependent on the volume of mail sent by a mailer in a past year or years or on the participation by a mailer in a rate incentive or promotion in a past year or years. A rate is not a rate of general applicability if it benefits only a single mailer. A rate that is only available upon the written agreement of both the Postal Service and a mailer, a group of mailers, or a foreign postal operator is not a rate of general applicability.
</P>
<P>(l) <I>Retirement obligation rate authority</I> means rate authority that is available to all classes to provide revenue for remittance towards the statutorily mandated amortization payments for unfunded liabilities.
</P>
<P>(m) A <I>seasonal or temporary rate</I> is a rate that is in effect for a limited and defined period of time.

<HEAD>§ 3030.128   Calculation of percentage change in rates.</HEAD>
<P>(a) For the purpose of calculating the percentage change in rates, the current rate is the rate in effect at the time of the rate adjustment filing under § 3030.121 with the following exceptions:
</P>
<P>(1) A seasonal or temporary rate shall be identified and treated as a rate cell separate and distinct from the corresponding non-seasonal or permanent rate. When used with respect to a seasonal or temporary rate, the current rate is the most recent rate in effect for the rate cell, regardless of whether the seasonal or temporary rate is available at the time of the rate adjustment filing.
</P>
<P>(2) When used with respect to a rate cell that corresponds to a rate incentive that was previously excluded from the calculation of the percentage change in rates, the current rate is the full undiscounted rate in effect for the rate cell at the time of the rate adjustment filing, not the discounted rate in effect for the rate cell at such time.
</P>
<P>(b) For the purpose of calculating the percentage change in rates, the volume for each rate cell shall be obtained from the most recently available 12 months of Postal Service billing determinants with the following permissible adjustments:
</P>
<P>(1) The Postal Service shall make reasonable adjustments to the billing determinants to account for the effects of classification changes such as the introduction, deletion, or redefinition of rate cells. The Postal Service shall identify and explain all adjustments. All information and calculations relied upon to develop the adjustments shall be provided together with an explanation of why the adjustments are appropriate.
</P>
<P>(2) Whenever possible, adjustments shall be based on known mail characteristics or historical volume data, as opposed to forecasts of mailer behavior.
</P>
<P>(3) For an adjustment accounting for the effects of the deletion of a rate cell when an alternate rate cell is not available, the Postal Service should adjust the billing determinants associated with the rate cell to 0. If the Postal Service does not adjust the billing determinants for the rate cell to 0, the Postal Service shall include a rationale for its treatment of the rate cell with the information required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
</P>
<P>(c) For a rate adjustment that involves a rate increase, for each class of mail and product within the class, the percentage change in rates is calculated in three steps. First, the volume of each rate cell in the class is multiplied by the planned rate for the respective cell and the resulting products are summed. Second, the same set of rate cell volumes is multiplied by the corresponding current rate for each cell and the resulting products are summed. Third, the percentage change in rates is calculated by dividing the results of the first step by the results of the second step and subtracting 1 from the quotient. The result is expressed as a percentage.
</P>
<P>(d) For rate adjustments that only involve a rate decrease, for each class of mail and product within the class, the percentage change in rates is calculated by amending the workpapers attached to the Commission's order relating to the most recent rate adjustment filing that involved a rate increase to replace the planned rates under the most recent rate adjustment filing that involves a rate increase with the corresponding planned rates applicable to the class from the rate adjustment filing involving only a rate decrease.

<P>(f)(1) Rate incentives may be excluded from a percentage change in rates calculation. If the Postal Service elects to exclude a rate incentive from a percentage change in rates calculation, the rate incentive shall be treated in the same manner as a rate under a negotiated service agreement (as described in paragraph (g) of this section).
</P>
<P>(2) A rate incentive may be included in a percentage change in rates calculation if it meets the following criteria:
</P>
<P>(i) The rate incentive is in the form of a discount or can be easily translated into a discount;
</P>
<P>(ii) Sufficient billing determinants are available for the rate incentive to be included in the percentage change in rate calculation for the class, which may be adjusted based on known mail characteristics or historical volume data (as opposed to forecasts of mailer behavior); and
</P>
<P>(iii) The rate incentive is either:
</P>
<P>(A) A rate of general applicability; or
</P>
<P>(B) A rate not of general applicability that satisfies the following requirements:
</P>
<P>(<I>1</I>) The rate incentive is not only available upon the written agreement of both the Postal Service and a mailer, or group of mailers, or a foreign postal operator;
</P>
<P>(<I>2</I>) The rate incentive is applicable to all mail meeting standards established by the Mail Classification Schedule, the Domestic Mail Manual, and the International Mail Manual;
</P>
<P>(<I>3</I>) The rate incentive does not benefit only a single mailer;
</P>
<P>(<I>4</I>) The rate incentive is designed to increase volume; and
</P>
<P>(<I>5</I>) A mailer's eligibility for the rate incentive depends on the mailer's sending, in a specified period of time, a volume of mail of specified products that exceeds a specified threshold volume of mail, provided that such threshold volume of mail is not less than the volume of the specified products that the mailer sent in the rate incentive comparison period.
</P>
<P>(3) The Commission may require submission of such information as it deems necessary to ensure that rate incentives included in the percentage change in rates calculation comply with the requirements of this section.
</P>
<P>(g)(1) Mail volumes sent at rates under a negotiated service agreement or a rate incentive that is not a rate of general applicability are to be included in the calculation of the percentage change in rates under this section as though they paid the appropriate rates of general applicability, except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. Where it is impractical to identify the rates of general applicability (<I>e.g.,</I> because unique rate categories are created for a mailer), the volumes associated with the mail sent under the terms of the negotiated service agreement or the rate incentive that is not a rate of general applicability shall be excluded from the calculation of the percentage change in rates.
</P>
<P>(2) The Postal Service shall identify and explain all assumptions it makes with respect to the treatment of negotiated service agreements and rate incentives that are not rates of general applicability in the calculation of the percentage change in rates and provide the rationale for its assumptions.

<P>(b) <I>Calculations.</I> (1) The amount of retirement obligation rate authority available for a fiscal year shall be calculated in four steps.

This sum represents the factor by which an equal increase in market dominant and competitive rates in the fiscal year under review would generate sufficient additional revenue to make the full amortization payment. It does not account, however, for any previous rate authority authorized under this subpart. The second step is therefore to subtract the proportion of the market dominant rate base resulting from previously authorized retirement obligation rate authority. That proportion is calculated using the formula in paragraph (a)(2) of this section as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Third, to amortize the resulting amount of retirement obligation rate authority over the remainder of the phase-in period, the difference shall be raised to the power of the inverse of the number of determinations remaining in the phase-in period, including the current determination. Finally, 1 shall be subtracted from the result to convert from a proportional change in rates to a percentage of rate adjustment authority.
</P>
<P>(2) The amount of previously authorized retirement obligation rate authority shall be calculated in two steps. First, the sums of 1 and the amount of retirement obligation rate authority authorized in each of the previous fiscal years shall be multiplied together. This product represents the compounded amount of such rate authority, expressed as a net rate increase. To express this product as a proportion of the market dominant rate base, the second step is to subtract the inverse of this product from 1.

<P>(c) <I>Calculations.</I> (1) The amount of revenue collected under this subpart during a fiscal year, as calculated by the formula in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall be calculated in three steps. First, the sums of 1 and the amount of retirement obligation rate authority made available under this subpart during each previous fiscal year—prorated to account for mid-year price increases as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section—shall be multiplied together. This product represents the proportion by which prices were higher during the most recently completed fiscal year as a result of retirement obligation rate authority. Second, to express this net price increase as a proportion of market dominant revenue, the inverse of this product shall be subtracted from 1. Finally, the result shall be multiplied by market dominant revenue for the fiscal year to change the proportion into a dollar amount.
</P>
<P>(2)(i) The prorated fraction of retirement obligation rate authority authorized in a particular fiscal year that was in effect during the most recently completed fiscal year, as calculated by the formula in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, shall be a piecewise function of three parts. First, if the retirement obligation rate authority authorized in a particular year was not in effect during the most recently completed fiscal year, the prorated fraction shall be 0. Second, if the retirement obligation rate authority authorized in a particular year was in effect during the entirety of the most recently completed fiscal year, the prorated fraction shall be 1. Finally, if the retirement obligation rate authority authorized in a particular fiscal year was used to raise prices during the most recently completed fiscal year, the prorated fraction shall be the proportion of volume sent during the fiscal year after that rate increase went into effect.
</P>
<P>(ii) The proportion in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section shall be calculated in four steps. First, the number of days of the fiscal quarter after and including the effective date of the price adjustment including the retirement obligation rate authority shall be divided by the total number of days in that fiscal quarter. This quotient determines the proportion of days in that quarter in which the higher rates were in effect. Second, that quotient shall be multiplied by the market dominant volume from that fiscal quarter to determine the amount of volume during the quarter receiving the higher rates. Third, that product shall be added to the market dominant volume from any subsequent quarters of the fiscal year because the volume in those quarters was also sent under the higher rates. Finally, this sum shall be divided by the total market dominant volume from the fiscal year to determine the proportion of annual volume sent after the rate increase went into effect.

<HEAD>§ 3030.286   Application for waiver.</HEAD>
<P>(a) In every instance in which the Postal Service determines to adjust a rate associated with a workshare discount in a manner that does not comply with the limitations imposed by §§ 3030.283 through 3030.284, the Postal Service shall file an application for waiver. The Postal Service must file any application for waiver at least 60 days prior to filing the proposal to adjust a rate associated with the applicable workshare discount. In its application for waiver, the Postal Service shall indicate the approximate filing date for its next rate adjustment filing.
</P>
<P>(b) The application for waiver shall be supported by a preponderance of the evidence and demonstrate that a waiver from the limitations imposed by §§ 3030.283 through 3030.284 should be granted. Preponderance of the evidence means proof by information that, compared with that opposing it, leads to the conclusion that the fact at issue is more probably true than not.
</P>
<P>(c) The application for waiver shall include a specific and detailed statement signed by one or more knowledgeable Postal Service official(s) who sponsors the application and attests to the accuracy of the information contained within the statement. The statement shall set forth the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (8) of this section, as applicable to the specific workshare discount for which a waiver is sought:
</P>
<P>(1) The reason(s) why a waiver is alleged to be necessary (with justification thereof), including all relevant supporting analysis and all assumptions relied upon.
</P>
<P>(2) The length of time for which a waiver is alleged to be necessary (with justification thereof).
</P>
<P>(3) For each subsequent rate adjustment filing planned to occur during the length of time for which a waiver is sought, a representation of the proposed minimum amount of the change to the workshare discount.
</P>
<P>(4) For a claim that the amount of the workshare discount exceeding the cost avoided by the Postal Service for not providing the applicable service is necessary in order to mitigate rate shock (39 U.S.C. 3622(e)(2)(B)), the Postal Service shall provide an explanation addressing all of the items specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section:
</P>
<P>(i) A description of the customers that the Postal Service claims would be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>(ii) Prices and volumes for the workshare discount at issue (the benchmark and workshared mail category) for the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>(iii) Quantitative analysis or, if not available, qualitative analysis indicating the nature and extent of the likely harm to the customers that would result from setting the workshare discount in compliance with § 3030.283(c).
</P>
<P>(5) For a claim that setting an excessive or low workshare discount closer or equal to the cost avoided by the Postal Service for not providing the applicable service would impede the efficient operation of the Postal Service, the Postal Service shall provide an explanation addressing all of the items specified in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section:
</P>
<P>(i) A description of the operational strategy at issue.
</P>
<P>(ii) Quantitative analysis or, if not available, qualitative analysis indicating how the workshare discount at issue is related to that operational strategy.
</P>
<P>(iii) How setting the workshare discount in compliance with § 3030.283(c) or § 3030.284(c), whichever is applicable, would impede that operational strategy.
</P>
<P>(6) For a claim that reducing or eliminating the excessive workshare discount would lead to a loss of volume in the affected category of mail and reduce the aggregate contribution to the Postal Service's institutional costs from the mail that is subject to the discount (39 U.S.C. 3622(e)(3)(A)), the Postal Service shall provide an explanation addressing all of the items specified in paragraphs (c)(6)(i) through (iii) of this section:
</P>
<P>(i) A description of the affected category of mail.
</P>
<P>(ii) Quantitative analysis or, if not available, qualitative analysis indicating the expected loss of volume and reduced contribution that is claimed would result from reducing or eliminating the excessive workshare discount.
</P>
<P>(iii) How setting the excessive workshare discount in compliance with § 3030.283(c) would lead to the expected loss of volume and reduced contribution.
</P>
<P>(7) For a claim that reducing or eliminating the excessive workshare discount would result in a further increase in the rates paid by mailers not able to take advantage of the workshare discount (39 U.S.C. 3622(e)(3)(B)), or a claim that increasing or eliminating a low workshare discount for a non-compensatory product would result in a further increase in the rates paid by mailers not able to take advantage of the workshare discount, the Postal Service shall provide an explanation addressing all of the items specified in paragraphs (c)(7)(i) through (iii) of this section:
</P>
<P>(i) A description of the mailers not able to take advantage of the discount.
</P>
<P>(ii) Quantitative analysis or, if not available, qualitative analysis indicating the expected size of the rate increase that is claimed would result in the rates paid by mailers not able to take advantage of the discount.
</P>
<P>(iii) How setting the excessive workshare discount in compliance with § 3030.283(c) or the low workshare discount for a non-compensatory product in compliance with § 3030.284(c) or (e), whichever is applicable, would result in a further increase in the rates paid by mailers not able to take advantage of the discount.
</P>
<P>(8) Any other relevant factors or reasons to support the application for waiver.
</P>
<P>(d) Unless the Commission otherwise provides, commenters will be given at least 7 calendar days to respond to the application for waiver after it has been filed by the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>(e) To better evaluate the waiver application, the Commission may, on its own behalf or by request of any interested person, order the Postal Service to provide experts on the subject matter of the waiver application to participate in technical conferences, prepare statements clarifying or supplementing their views, or answer questions posed by the Commission or its representatives.
</P>
<P>(f) For a proposed workshare discount that would exceed the cost avoided by the Postal Service for not providing the applicable service, the application for waiver shall be granted only if at least one provision appearing in 39 U.S.C. 3622(e)(2)(A) through (e)(2)(D) or 39 U.S.C. 3622(e)(3)(A) through (e)(3)(B) is determined to apply.
</P>
<P>(g) For a proposed workshare discount that would be set below the cost avoided by the Postal Service for not providing the applicable service, the application for waiver shall be granted only if setting the workshare discount closer or equal to the cost avoided by the Postal Service for not providing the applicable service would impede the efficient operation of the Postal Service or if increasing or eliminating a low workshare discount for a non-compensatory product would result in a further increase in the rates paid by mailers not able to take advantage of the workshare discount.
</P>
<P>(h) The Commission will issue an order announcing, at a minimum, whether the requested waiver will be granted or denied no later than 21 days following the close of any comment period(s). An order granting the application for waiver shall specify all conditions upon which the waiver is granted, including the date upon which the waiver shall expire.

</P>
<P>(i) Minimum rates for all rate cells;
</P>
<P>(ii) Projected volume for all rate cells;

</P>
<P>(5) Identify each way in which proposed products could differ from the existing competitive product(s) identified in paragraph (c)(4) of this section;
</P>
<P>(6) Explain why the potential differences identified in paragraph (c)(5) of this section do not cause any proposed products to satisfy the definition of a market dominant product within the meaning of 39 U.S.C. 3642(b)(1); and
</P>
<P>(7) Identify the Mail Classification Schedule section in which proposed products will be listed and provide any proposed changes therein in legislative format.
</P>
<P>(d) The financial model must:
</P>
<P>(1) Demonstrate that each negotiated service agreement that will use the minimum rates is not inconsistent with the standards of 39 U.S.C. 3633; and
</P>
<P>(2) Rely on reasonable and reliable projected cost, revenue, and volume data.
</P>
<P>(e) The Mail Classification Schedule entry, including any proposed changes, must:

</P>
<P>(f) The Commission will issue an order authorizing the proposed financial model, minimum rates, and any Mail Classification Schedule changes for use in requests to add standardized distinct products and non-published rates products to the competitive product list if, after review, the Commission finds that:
</P>
<P>(1) The financial model and minimum rates are not inconsistent with the standards of 39 U.S.C. 3633;
</P>
<P>(2) The products using such proposed financial model, minimum rates, and Mail Classification Schedule changes will be competitive products; and
</P>
<P>(3) The proposed Mail Classification Schedule changes comply with the requirements of this section and are not inconsistent with the proposed financial model.
</P>
<P>(g) As a condition of any authorization issued pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, the Postal Service shall be required to update the financial model whenever more accurate or complete cost, revenue, or volume data are available and no less frequently than every 12 months from the date on which such authorization is granted. Upon review of any updated financial model, the Commission may require changes to any applicable minimum rates to ensure that the minimum rates are not inconsistent with the standards of 39 U.S.C. 3633.

The resulting Base Average is 214.463. Then, a second simple average CPI-U index is similarly calculated for each subsequent fiscal year by summing the 12 monthly CPI-U values for the previous fiscal year and dividing the sum by 12 (Recent Average). Finally, the annual limitation for the current fiscal year is calculated by multiplying $10,000,000 by the Recent Average divided by 214.463.
